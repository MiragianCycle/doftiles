- What do I mean by an [[Integrated_Writing_Environment]]?
    - I started paying attention to the tools and workflows of programmers - after I read a piece on Medium that basically argued that the state of software that is shipped to consumers is positively primitive compared to the software that we make for software engineers  
- What does Integrated mean?
- How I used to take notes and research?
- Why Vim?
