==IP Addresses==

1. IP Addresses are part of *Layer 3* of the OSI Model [[Networking - NW-CS|Networking - NW-CS]]
2. Like all digital information, IP addresses are also binary with 1s and 0s  
    i. Consider the following numbers
    
| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 | if you add these numbers, it is 255
|-----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|
| 1   | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | if you add these numbers, is is 7

3. IPv4 has *32bits*. So 2^32 = *4,292,9967,296* is the number of total available IP addresses. This number was taught more than adequate back in the 80s at the start of the computing era, but the explosive growth of the internet has resulted in all these IP addresses being utilized. 
4. IPv6 was brought to resolve the capacity issues with IPv4
5. IPv6 is a 128bit hexadecimal number. Therefore, using the same mathematical formule as above, i.e. 2^128, we get a number that is very very large. 
6. IPv6 is still used in networks - so if we 'ran out' of IP addresses then how are we still using them in real life scenarios?
7. This is because we have something called Network Address Translation ([[NAT]])
8. Now consider your local network. In my case, I have 5 devices connected at a single time - does this mean that we are taking 5 out of these precious 4 billion IP addresses? 

No. Instead, the following is happening without you realizing. 
                    - We are using NAT to solve this issue 
                    - NAT assigns private IP addresses such as 192.168 or 10.0.0.0
                    - These are called private IP addresses 
                    - These private IP addresses belong to classes titled CLASS A, CLASS B, and CLASS C
                    - CLASS A Private IP Addresses include 10.0.0.0
                    - CLASS B Private IP Addresses include 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.0.0
                    - CLASS C Private IP Addresses include 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
                    - In addition to the above, we have LOOPBACK (localhost) which is usually between 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.7
                    - CLASS C is most common in households and small businesses  
                    - CLASS A can have apprx. 16,600,000 hosts in a network
                    - CLASS B can have apprx. 65,000 hosts in a machine
                    - CLASS C can have apprx 254 machines in a network
                    - When you sign up with an ISP, you are essentially leasing an IP address from them
                    - As we mentioned, IP addresses are Layer 3. This means that your router is part of Layer 3 of the OSI Model.
