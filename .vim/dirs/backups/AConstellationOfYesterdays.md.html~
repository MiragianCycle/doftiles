<span id="L36" class="LineNr">  36 </span>
<span id="L37" class="LineNr">  37 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Yara Mahasen had understood from a young age that he had to choose between a life of servitude and survival - or find and start climbing the invisible ladder every society has. He had no interest in servitude so Yara chose survival while looking for the ladder. </span>
<span id="L38" class="LineNr">  38 </span>
<span id="L39" class="LineNr">  39 </span><span class="htmlItalic">One afternoon, as his fellow clerks gulped the thin gruel that was served during lunch every day of their working lives, he found it. Yara asked the other clerks if they thought this, pushing the bowl aside, was reasonable. The men stopped talking. A minute earlier their conversations had concerned their children, and the rising costs of feeding and educating them but now Yara asked the question that floated in their minds. </span>
<span id="L40" class="LineNr">  40 </span>
<span id="L41" class="LineNr">  41 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘This’s the way it has always been, Yara. You only here a few months’, a middle-aged man with missing teeth said. ‘This is our fate.’ </span>
<span id="L42" class="LineNr">  42 </span>
<span id="L43" class="LineNr">  43 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Then our fate is no better than that of insects living in fear of some asshole trampling out their existence. Are you all insects?’, the question punched them. He let it sink into their heads. ‘Even insects eat better that this shit they give us!’ </span>
<span id="L44" class="LineNr">  44 </span>
<span id="L45" class="LineNr">  45 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The table was silent. ‘What are you saying?’</span>
<span id="L46" class="LineNr">  46 </span>
<span id="L47" class="LineNr">  47 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘I am saying we don’t leave our fate in the hands of others. I am saying we demand a rise in wages. Better food!’, he raised the note at the end. ‘I am saying we protest until the demands are met.’ </span>
<span id="L48" class="LineNr">  48 </span>
<span id="L49" class="LineNr">  49 </span><span class="htmlItalic">There were polite giggles at first, but transformed into a finger-pointing-laughing fit that erupted when the man with missing teeth announced to the hall Yara Mahasen’s plan. ‘Insects have to work for bosses too, silly bastard!’, someone shouted as Yara stormed out. </span>
<span id="L50" class="LineNr">  50 </span>
<span id="L51" class="LineNr">  51 </span><span class="htmlItalic">That night, still panting from making love to his teenage wife Ella, ‘I’m going on a hunger strike tomorrow. Going to demand better wages starting tomorrow.’ </span>
<span id="L52" class="LineNr">  52 </span>
<span id="L53" class="LineNr">  53 </span><span class="htmlItalic">No amount of pleading from Ella could change his mind. The next morning Yara set off early to the Town Council dressed in earthy red instead of the uniform brown khaki his work obligated him to wear. He sat at the foot of the stairs, laid out his banner, and began a fast that lasted a fortnight. </span>
<span id="L54" class="LineNr">  54 </span>
<span id="L55" class="LineNr">  55 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The other clerks were taken aback but agreed the young man was brave; stupid, but brave. ‘Coming to his senses soon enough, young bloods always do’, they told themselves. As hours turned to days, they stepped out of their dusty offices to see if the mad Yara had finally given into hunger. He hadn’t. Ella had now joined him too. Husband and young wife sat at the foot of the stairs leading to the Council Building. Young, impressionable clerks soon joined them. Some were accompanied by their wives. The older ones shook their head, refusing to participate.    </span>
<span id="L56" class="LineNr">  56 </span>
<span id="L57" class="LineNr">  57 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ten days passed with little incident. The Councilmen and Administrators, until then ignoring the protests, finally began to notice their absence from work: The system was failing. What took an hour’s paper work stretched into days, and what took days was lost in a limbo of creaky cupboards and rusty file cabinets. </span>
<span id="L58" class="LineNr">  58 </span>
<span id="L59" class="LineNr">  59 </span><span class="htmlItalic">They came to Yara with promises and then thinly-veiled threats but Yara wouldn’t move until they signed a new wage increase and passed it publicly at the next meeting of the Town Council.  His patience exhausted, the Mayor responded by ordering the police to arrest the protestors for public nuisance and to force-feed them lest they continue their fast in jail. </span>
<span id="L60" class="LineNr">  60 </span>
<span id="L61" class="LineNr">  61 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The crowd of protestors scattered as soon as they saw the police moving in, running with what little energy their bodies had left but Yara and Ella sat motionless like a pair of meditating statues. Whips and blows rained down upon them. The more Yara and Ella refused to fight back the angrier the police became.  </span>
<span id="L62" class="LineNr">  62 </span>
<span id="L63" class="LineNr">  63 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The clerks watched from their offices as the officers dragged Ella by her hair, along the rocky path where tiny stones pressed against her exposed hips and ankles, scraping, and biting into her skin. </span>
<span id="L64" class="LineNr">  64 </span>
<span id="L65" class="LineNr">  65 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The unconscious bodies were then cruelly tossed into the back of their jeeps and driven off. Yara and Ella were sent to prison. No charges were pressed against them. The newspapers the next morning made no mention of this event. </span>
<span id="L66" class="LineNr">  66 </span>
<span id="L67" class="LineNr">  67 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Yara was put in solitary confinement for the first month. Every day he groped to the corner of the dark room and prepared for the terrifying arrival of light: the harsh rays of torches pointed at his face, the aggressive steps of men rushing towards him, grabbing his limbs, pinning him against the wall, and inserting a tube through his nose that snaked its way to his throat and into him stomach. One day, the snake missed and entered his lung. It was only the body’s panicked gag reflex that pushed the tube out before it excreted the gruel </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">the</span><span class="Green"> same gruel that had driven Yara to protest in the first place&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> into his lung. </span>
<span id="L68" class="LineNr">  68 </span>
<span id="L69" class="LineNr">  69 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ella, meanwhile, was among madams, whores, drug pushers and abusers, and women who had killed their abusive husbands; these women who had removed the mask of equality that society wore and spat on its patriarchal face, watched this pretty, bruised and limping girl walk out to the yard for the first time, and they felt the stirring of what they long assumed had died inside of them: a maternal instinct. No more could the guards force-feed Ella without facing a riot in the prison. Instead, the oldest inmates had taken it upon themselves to gently coax her into eating. When they came to learn she was pregnant a few weeks later, the younger ones created a roster of women watching over her throughout the night. Jara was a prison baby for the first six months of his life. A whole year passed before Yara would even know that his wife was alive - and that she had borne him a son.</span>
<span id="L70" class="LineNr">  70 </span>
<span id="L71" class="LineNr">  71 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Jara and Yara were two important members of Miragian mythology. Though twins, they were never seen together; the predominant school of thought explained this curiosity away by claiming that the former was responsible for creation and the latter for destruction – and that these two forces could never mix in the same space and time without destroying that space and that time, causing the cycle of life to begin anew. Jara had a more elegant explanation for the never-seen-together twins: they were both one person, a man whose deep slumber was the creation of the universe; and his irritated waking its destruction. </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">Many</span><span class="Green"> years later, days after his father’s funeral, Jara would find Yara’s unpublished novel, The History of Time and Time Again in which the latter would expand on this hypothesis.&gt;</span>
<span id="L72" class="LineNr">  72 </span>
<span id="L73" class="LineNr">  73 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Meanwhile, outside the prison walls, the Association of State Administrative Clerks of Toliara, </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">The</span><span class="Green"> ASACT’s members would in time become the first members of a new political party, founded on promoting and enhancing workers’ rights&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> had formed. A unanimous condemnation of the police’s actions towards Yara and Ella was the first motion to pass. </span>
<span id="L74" class="LineNr">  74 </span>
<span id="L75" class="LineNr">  75 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Trade union action, the first in modern Miragian history, was the second.  </span>
<span id="L76" class="LineNr">  76 </span>
<span id="L77" class="LineNr">  77 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The Town Council stopped functioning completely but refused to recognize the ASACT’s authority. Again, the police were called, but this time the protestors took a different route: they hit back at the police. The ensuing riot lasted only a few hours, but killed 40 clerks, 15 police officers, five women, and two children. It would go down in Miragian history as the Toliara Town Square Massacre. This time, the unrest made the news. Trade Unions mushroomed across the country every day, riots followed every other day. Thousands </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">officially</span><span class="Green"> 11,275&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> of people were killed in less than a year of chaos. Some simply disappeared without a trace. When the Miragian Army finally squashed the rebellion </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">official</span><span class="Green"> policy forbade anyone from the state machinery to call it a ‘civil war’&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic">, the toll on the national psyche was so much it felt like every citizen – army, rebel, civilian, politician – had PTSD to last a lifetime. Only prisoners were spared; Yara, Ella, Jara and inmates across Mirage had prison walls to protect them from the collective trauma of watching a brief and vicious uprising almost burn the country down to ashes. </span>
<span id="L78" class="LineNr">  78 </span>
<span id="L79" class="LineNr">  79 </span><span class="htmlItalic">A national process of truth-finding was called for. The Miragian Supreme Court passed a court order for the immediate release of Yara, Ella, and the prison baby Jara. The Executive branch relented. A year later, Yara ran for and won a seat representing his borough at the Town Council. </span>
<span id="L80" class="LineNr">  80 </span>
<span id="L81" class="LineNr">  81 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Nobody at 21. </span>
<span id="L82" class="LineNr">  82 </span>
<span id="L83" class="LineNr">  83 </span><span class="htmlItalic">15 months in prison. </span>
<span id="L84" class="LineNr">  84 </span>
<span id="L85" class="LineNr">  85 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Councilman at 24. </span>
<span id="L86" class="LineNr">  86 </span>
<span id="L87" class="LineNr">  87 </span><span class="htmlItalic">His first act as Councilman: Better meals at work. ‘Either that or there’ll be more riots in our town square. The bloodshed will once again be on those who choose to treat us like we are dirt’, he said ending his speech. It was a threat made in a sombre tone, in a room that was overflowing with clerks from across the country. They cheered everything he said, and drowned out any councillor who dared to be contrarian. </span>
<span id="L88" class="LineNr">  88 </span>
<span id="L89" class="LineNr">  89 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Five years later he contested for the Presidency of the Council under his newly formed Miragian Workers Party </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">which</span><span class="Green">, coincidentally, chose a ladder as the party symbol&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic">. He won by a landslide, eventually serving three terms before the ladder showed itself again; then it was provincial politics and finally national politics. From an iconic figure in the struggle for workers’ rights, Jara sensed the culmination of his political and personal ambitions when he was unanimously chosen as the common opposition candidate in the Miragian Presidential elections. ’92 began in grand fashion. His son was now a senator himself, his third grandson was on his way, and the polls painted a picture in his mind of political perfection: his inevitable victory speech, flanked on either side by Ella, Jara and his pregnant wife Yami, and their sons Manal and Hasyl. But Yara knew that that would only be the beginning; that the writing of political legacy was a long and painstaking process. He would only be alive to write the first pages and then it would be Jara’s turn, and then his sons’ and their sons’ afterwards to continue writing the book until it came to a point in time when no one could imagine a life where the name Mahasen was not uttered by every Miragian.  </span>
<span id="L90" class="LineNr">  90 </span>
<span id="L91" class="LineNr">  91 </span><span class="htmlItalic">As he waved to the crowds, a </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">on</span><span class="Green"> hindsight, an over-earnest&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> young man at the front row waved at him, begging him for a photograph. Yara stepped down from the podium and walked towards the boy who handed him a copy of Yara’s election manifesto.  ‘Sign for me, sir, so I may be a small part of Miragian history.’ The crowd cheered and the photographers clicked while Jara, still on the stage, saw what looked like the boy’s belly combusting. The boy’s head then snapped itself from his torso. Jara was thrown back twenty feet, crashing through the back of the podium and landing in the mud outside; miraculously, he only had minor scars. Yara’s body lay scattered: his right hand cruelly landing at the foot of a giant poster of him that read, ‘For A Just Nation’, his face punctured by nails and blackened by the explosion. </span>
<span id="L92" class="LineNr">  92 </span>
<span id="L93" class="LineNr">  93 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ella locked herself in her private chambers after the funeral and saw no one but her assistant Ohiy, a former inmate she had befriended while in prison. </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">Ohiy</span><span class="Green"> had, among other things, fulfilled the dual roles of elder sister-figure to Ella and nanny to Jara while in prison. She continued with the latter duties as soon as she was released, bringing up and providing private tuition in Languages and Arithmetic to not one but four Mahasen boys spread over five decades.&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> The assassination had made Jara, until then a reluctant politician who played the game for his father’s sake, a more focused and dangerous political animal during the day. During the night, he was haunted by that image of the combusting boy </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">a</span><span class="Green"> corrosive memory he would fight every night </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> the rest of his life&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic">. Yami, pregnant and fragile, moved into her mother’s house to prepare for the birth of her baby. Manal and Hasyl, also unsuccessful in getting their father’s attention, went with her. </span>
<span id="L94" class="LineNr">  94 </span>
<span id="L95" class="LineNr">  95 </span><span class="htmlItalic">In the final week before she went into labour, Yami confided to her mother unease over a recurrent dream: of seeing a lonely man on the moon who sat watching his world on the blue planet in the distance perish before his very eyes. Every day this dream would advance its narrative, not act by act but scene by scene. And on the seventh day, as Yami lay on the hospital bed, legs spread, she croaked a name repeatedly. Her dream had arrived to its devastating conclusion: the young man who was dying of loneliness was her unborn sun and his name was Deva. ‘I can see what he will become’, she cried to Jara while fighting labour pains, ‘I can see what he will do because he is of all not of one and in my dreams I called out to him, this son I haven’t given birth to yet, as I saw him become one of all with the hindsight of all lifetimes and all memories and I watched the sudden stiffness of his body and knew my son was dying like a star. I am staring into my unborn son’s dying eyes. Do you understand me, Jara?’ She was hysterical. ‘I am staring into my unborn son’s dying eyes at this very moment.’ </span>
<span id="L96" class="LineNr">  96 </span>
<span id="L97" class="LineNr">  97 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Yami left our Miragian domain as Dev entered it and was freed from his umbilical cord.</span>
<span id="L98" class="LineNr">  98 </span>
<span id="L99" class="LineNr">  99 </span>
<span id="L100" class="LineNr"> 100 </span>
<span id="L101" class="LineNr"> 101 </span><span class="htmlItalic">His first memory of the Mahasen home was its echo. </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">Years</span><span class="Green"> later in his lunar home, as he watched Mirage being destroyed, he would recall that first memory and experience a terrible nostalgic yearning </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> that moment in time. He had photographs of his childhood, of course, but those were the images seen through the eyes of other men, at different points in the cycle of life. Nothing from his childhood beaconed with as much light as this aural memory. It seemed to the older Dev that the infant Dev was enchanted by the many voices that reverberated around the hall, stairs and passageways, and drifted into his room: it was his first music.&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> In the absence of a mother, Dev’s primary maternal influence came from his grandmother and Ohiy. The latter would be the first to greet him in the morning. Opening the curtains every day, she’s let the morning rays hit Dev’s face. The infant Dev then spent the rest of the day in his grandmother’s chambers.  Ohiy sometimes sang. She didn’t possess the voice or the subtlety of a traditional songstress for children: from her Dev learnt the stomping words of revolutionary songs. His grandmother on occasion read to him excerpts from Yara’s unpublished novel. </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">The</span><span class="Green"> opening passage was one of Dev’s favourite as a child: On the day the boy Veda woke up a man, having no knowledge, no memory of time before that very moment, he saw </span><span class="Aqua">above</span><span class="Green"> him the a great blue canvas of sky at the centre of which was a cloud that painted pictures: of a desert oasis that must be found and fertilized with his seed so that a race of men may live and thrive on it. EXCERPT FROM THE UNPUBLISHED NOVEL, A History of Time and Time Again, BY YARA MAHASEN, Pg 1&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic">. This image of promise and hope that tinge new beginnings was especially lucid when uttered by his grandmother. </span>
<span id="L102" class="LineNr"> 102 </span>
<span id="L103" class="LineNr"> 103 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The novel though had limited appeal within the family. Jara, haunted as he was by the image of his father’s last moment in time, refused to read it; Manal and Hasyl had no interest in reading at all. It was left to Dev to be the first among the Mahasens to complete reading the patriarch’s only written work. This he did at the crack of dawn on his seventh birthday. </span>

<span id="L121" class="LineNr"> 121 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The breakfast table was laid out. Manal and Hasyl were already seated when Dev walked in, and were waiting for Jara. Dev took his seat. ‘Manal and Hasyl Mahasen, what day is it today? Should I have to remind you of common courtesy? Is this what I have taught you two?’ ‘Happy birthday, little brother’, Manal said. ‘Seven years old, eh? Look at you, all grown up and shit.’ Ohiy looked annoyed at Manal shaking her in disapproval at the language. ‘Sorry, Miss Ohiy.’ ‘Well…wish him a happy birthday now. What’s wrong with you?’ ‘Happy birthday, Dev.’</span>
<span id="L122" class="LineNr"> 122 </span>
<span id="L123" class="LineNr"> 123 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Thank –  </span>
<span id="L124" class="LineNr"> 124 </span>
<span id="L125" class="LineNr"> 125 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The sound of many footsteps approaching the table made Dev stop. His father’s gravel voice could be heard in the living room issuing directives to his staff but he was alone when he appeared at the breakfast table. ‘Morning, boys.’ ‘Good morning, father’, the Mahasen brothers said together. ‘Happy birthday, Dev. Why are your eyes red? Are you alright?’ ‘He didn’t sleep well, Mr Mahasen. He was up all night reading.’ ‘Ahh so you finished paataach’s book?’</span>
<span id="L126" class="LineNr"> 126 </span>
<span id="L127" class="LineNr"> 127 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Yes.</span>
<span id="L128" class="LineNr"> 128 </span>
<span id="L129" class="LineNr"> 129 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Did you like it?’</span>
<span id="L130" class="LineNr"> 130 </span>
<span id="L131" class="LineNr"> 131 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I did. I want to read it again when I am older and can understand what he was trying to say. You should read it too. </span>
<span id="L132" class="LineNr"> 132 </span>
<span id="L133" class="LineNr"> 133 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Jara’s face briefly turned sour. ‘I have no time for stories now, Dev. You know that very well.’ ‘What do you mean you want to read it again?’ Hasyl chimed in. ‘You are like the most boring seven-year-old I ever met.’ Jara caught himself from laughing. ‘Watch it now, Hasyl’, Ohiy was taking her seat at the table. ‘Sorry, Miss Ohiy.’ Hasyl continued staring at Dev and mouthed ‘boring’. A calling bell went off then. ‘Excuse me, Mr Mahasen. Your mother is awake.’ Ohiy left the table. The Mahasens ate breakfast in silence for a while. ‘So...why do you want to read paataach’s book again?’ It was Manal who asked this time, and unlike Hasyl there was no nasty edge to the question. </span>
<span id="L134" class="LineNr"> 134 </span>
<span id="L135" class="LineNr"> 135 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Well...when Veda turns a hundred years old his sons, Saman, Shiva and Adam become impatient with their father. They wonder why it was that he hadn’t died yet, but they remain hopeful that he would soon so they prepare themselves to be his rightful heir.</span>
<span id="L136" class="LineNr"> 136 </span>
<span id="L137" class="LineNr"> 137 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Shouldn’t it be the oldest one?’ asked Manal. </span>
<span id="L138" class="LineNr"> 138 </span>
<span id="L139" class="LineNr"> 139 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The sons are triplets. </span>
<span id="L140" class="LineNr"> 140 </span>
<span id="L141" class="LineNr"> 141 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Go on, Dev.’ His father was feigning interest. He wanted this topic closed. </span>
<span id="L142" class="LineNr"> 142 </span>
<span id="L143" class="LineNr"> 143 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Years go by and Veda doesn’t die, he is well over a hundred years by then, and his impatient sons begin to fight for their piece of the giant oasis. Their families go to war against each other. They destroy each other and eventually their nation ceases to be. One day Veda wakes up and realizes that Mirage had disappeared and all that was left was an endless desert. He searches every corner of this desert for ten years – Veda doesn’t sleep, doesn’t eat, doesn’t drink any water but he finds no trace of a single man, woman or child. He wonders if it was all just a dream. So he spends the rest of his life learning how to sleep in the hope that he’ll dream the same dream. </span>
<span id="L144" class="LineNr"> 144 </span>
<span id="L145" class="LineNr"> 145 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The room was quiet. Every plate except Hasyl’s was half finished. ‘Does he see the same dream?’</span>
<span id="L146" class="LineNr"> 146 </span>
<span id="L147" class="LineNr"> 147 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The book doesn’t say. </span>
<span id="L148" class="LineNr"> 148 </span>
<span id="L149" class="LineNr"> 149 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Then what is to gain in reading this book again?’, Jara masked his annoyance well. </span>
<span id="L150" class="LineNr"> 150 </span>
<span id="L151" class="LineNr"> 151 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Why didn’t he stop his sons from fighting? </span>

<span id="L153" class="LineNr"> 153 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘I want to know why you don’t discuss your school work with as much enthusiasm as you do these fairy tales your grandfather cooked up when he was bored’, Jara snapped. </span>
<span id="L154" class="LineNr"> 154 </span>
<span id="L155" class="LineNr"> 155 </span><span class="htmlItalic">But this is his only written work, father. </span>
<span id="L156" class="LineNr"> 156 </span>
<span id="L157" class="LineNr"> 157 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Then why didn’t he have it published then?’ </span>
<span id="L158" class="LineNr"> 158 </span>
<span id="L159" class="LineNr"> 159 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Maybe he wanted only his family to read it. </span>

<span id="L163" class="LineNr"> 163 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I’ll know when I read it again. </span>
<span id="L164" class="LineNr"> 164 </span>
<span id="L165" class="LineNr"> 165 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The elder Mahasen sighed. ‘Please stop. I don’t want to discuss that silly book again. Do you understand me?’ </span>
<span id="L166" class="LineNr"> 166 </span>
<span id="L167" class="LineNr"> 167 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Father, it’s his birthday. Go easy on him.’ </span>

<span id="L169" class="LineNr"> 169 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Oh and you are the man of the house now, Manal? Since when? I wasn’t told.’ Jara was now glaring at Manal. His eldest didn’t respond. Even Hasyl, by now going for seconds, stopped eating. ‘Answer me now, Manal. Are you the man of this house?’ ‘No, father.’ ‘Then you’ll not interrupt me when I am disciplining your brother. Clear?’ ‘Yes, father.’ ‘Good’, Jara went back to finishing his plate quickly. ‘I am sorry, Dev. And you too, Manal. I shouldn’t be this grumpy in the morning. It is work you see.’ His plate was now done. ‘I will see you tonight. We’ll have a quiet family dinner.’ </span>
<span id="L170" class="LineNr"> 170 </span>
<span id="L171" class="LineNr"> 171 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Manal walked over to Dev. ‘Don’t be upset, little man. You know how he is today.’ </span>

<span id="L173" class="LineNr"> 173 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I am okay. </span>

<span id="L175" class="LineNr"> 175 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘It is your fault’, Hasyl had found his voice now that Jara and Ohiy weren’t in the room. ‘It is the little fucker’s fault. If he hadn’t kill – ‘Manal’s slap caught Hasyl on the eye above his left cheek. ‘He’s seven. You are his older brother – act like it. I swear I’ll break your fucking -’ His hands over his left eye, a tear streaming down, Hasyl cowered into a corner expecting another blow. </span>

<span id="L179" class="LineNr"> 179 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ohiy had walked in and seen the conflict brewing and hadn’t stopped it, but stepped in when the tension escalated from verbals to physical altercation. ‘Deva, aren’t you hungry?’ </span>
<span id="L180" class="LineNr"> 180 </span>
<span id="L181" class="LineNr"> 181 </span><span class="htmlItalic">No, Miss Ohiy.</span>

<span id="L187" class="LineNr"> 187 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘As for you two idiots’, she said turning towards Manal and Hasyl, ‘Is this the kind of language to use in front of your baby brother?’ Deva left the dining hall as his brothers continued being reprimanded by Ohiy. Ella’s room was the furthest down the hall on the house’s eastern wing. The smell of the balm Ella used to soothe her aching bones wafted out as he got closer to the door. He knocked before entering. His grandmother was seated near the window and watching clouds envelope Mirage’s Peak in the horizon. </span>

<span id="L196" class="LineNr"> 196 </span>
<span id="L197" class="LineNr"> 197 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev pushed the wheelchair towards the cupboard. Stately mahogany, the cupboard was always locked and Ella wore the key on her neck chain. She opened the door and began to rummage through its sparse contents. Suddenly, panic. ‘Where is it? Where is it?! I put it here – I know it! Ohiy – where is she?’ I’ve told her to never move important things from where I’ve kept them. Ohiy!’ she called out. </span>
<span id="L198" class="LineNr"> 198 </span>
<span id="L199" class="LineNr"> 199 </span><span class="htmlItalic">What are you looking for?</span>

<span id="L217" class="LineNr"> 217 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ella then became silent, her eyes settling on an area of nondescript floor. At times it seemed like she was grasping at words that would accurately describe her thought process at that moment, but those words were no longer coming from the wellspring of language; she had to fetch her words from a raging ocean instead, and put it together again so that it would be coherent, normal and Miragian sounding.  Her inability to do so was confusing for Dev to watch. </span>

<span id="L247" class="LineNr"> 247 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev pushed the chair towards the bed and gave Ella his hand.

<span id="L252" class="LineNr"> 252 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev slept through most of school that day. This wasn’t uncommon: Dev’s early education under Ohiy’s tutelage had provided him an excellent foundational education. Unfortunately, it meant he gave zero attention in class. Teachers, afraid to upset the son of an important politician, let him be. </span>
<span id="L253" class="LineNr"> 253 </span>
<span id="L254" class="LineNr"> 254 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev dreamt of old man Veda who woke up one morning, listened intently to the world outside and realized that Mirage, his oasis was gone, that his progeny, the bloodline of Vedas was gone. The soft, cool sheets of his bed were now hot sand that burnt the soles of his feet, his naked back and head. Above him, the sun was at its zenith. No cloud, no paintings on the blue canvas this time. He called out for his wife Rahvatpi but she died a long time ago, Veda he told himself as he began his search for the missing oasis. Ten years would pass before he came to a well. His tongue parched, Veda limped to it and dropped the bucket in. Splash! Oh heavenly Mother, my thirst will be quenched. He drew from the well and gulped the liquid whole. His thirst was such that it was only after he had swigged half way through that his malnourished brain warned him: this isn’t water. It was too late. Whatever he had drunk was beginning to take effect. </span>

<span id="L256" class="LineNr"> 256 </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">He</span><span class="Green"> was one among countless grains of sand being sucked into the black hole of disappearing time. The grain of sand that Veda had become was suffocating; </span><span class="Aqua">above</span><span class="Green">, beneath, by his sides, other grains of sand were also struggling against the titanic pull of the black hole, the desperate clawing-to-life of the grains </span><span class="Aqua">below</span><span class="Green"> cascading up in hysteria. There were no words to describe this nightmare </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> the Miragian tongue was born at a time of creation and birth – and knew not what death fully meant. Now Deva was near the black hole. He could feel the cushion of grains </span><span class="Aqua">below</span><span class="Green"> him becoming increasingly fragile. There was a moment of silence then as the final grain beneath him fell into the hole and he knew he was next. Space expanded and Veda felt happy </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> all the weight of collective memory was gone and he was free – alone still but free. As he fell, he looked around this transient narrow world that heralded his death. He emerged into even more space. And there was light. He could barely </span><span class="Aqua">open</span><span class="Green"> his eyes at the bright glare that greeted his arrival. He looked down as he continued to fall. Yes, </span><span class="Aqua">below</span><span class="Green"> the other grains had lived through this ordeal. They were confused, but they were alive. Veda became part of this rebirthed dune. The world is not an orb but an hourglass! Veda the grain of sand shouted in joy.  </span>

<span id="L258" class="LineNr"> 258 </span><span class="Green">He woke, his </span><span class="Aqua">face</span><span class="Green"> was buried, hot sand was on his tongue and in his mouth, little particles of sand irritated his eyes, tickled his nose.

<span id="L259" class="LineNr"> 259 </span>
<span id="L260" class="LineNr"> 260 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The sound of the school bell woke Dev up, shattering the beautiful images his grandfather’s words had conjured up, replacing it with his classmates and their inane chatter. The teacher looked exhausted. Dev made his way to the entrance of the school and walked east, but instead of turning into the lane that led to his home, he continued straight towards the Eastern Boroughs, known for its sole landmark: The Miragian National Library. </span>
<span id="L261" class="LineNr"> 261 </span>
<span id="L262" class="LineNr"> 262 </span><span class="htmlItalic">This was Dev’s first time in the library and its sheer size overwhelmed him. The library looked like the inside of a giant beehive. Dev half expected it to sound like a beehive, but instead there was an echo. A girl’s voice monologued in the distance. Dev realized she was reading out aloud. He followed the voice, a voice that didn’t so much read but sang the words off the pages. Soon he was going up stairs, down hallways and finally into a dusty corridor that led to a door on which read a sign DIRECTOR REJOG C RACKEL. The voice came from behind the door. Dev opened the door and peeped in. The singing stopped. </span>
<span id="L263" class="LineNr"> 263 </span>
<span id="L264" class="LineNr"> 264 </span><span class="htmlItalic">She was petite and her eyes seemed to always smile.  ‘Who is it, Ana?’ An old man’s voice then asked. He was seated with his back turned to the door. ‘I don’t know, grandfather.’ ‘Yes, who is it?’ the old man asked without turning his back. </span>
<span id="L265" class="LineNr"> 265 </span>
<span id="L266" class="LineNr"> 266 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Err…I am sorry, I just heard your voice and – sorry I didn’t realize. Sorry. </span>

<span id="L268" class="LineNr"> 268 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Wait, wait, young man. Come in here please.’ Dev walked in and towards the old man. He stood by the old man, but his and gaze remained towards his granddaughter. ‘Stand in front of me, please,’ Dev walked closer, realizing then that the old man was blind. ‘What is your name, young master?’ </span>

The bad news is neither I nor the writer who came up with that name know how it is pronounced. The good news is I now know who has the manuscript in which that four-handed God is mentioned: you.

<span id="L307" class="LineNr"> 307 </span>
<span id="L308" class="LineNr"> 308 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Yes, sir. </span>

<span id="L312" class="LineNr"> 312 </span><span class="htmlItalic">How do you know?</span>
<span id="L313" class="LineNr"> 313 </span>
<span id="L314" class="LineNr"> 314 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘We were friends, Yara and I.’</span>

<span id="L318" class="LineNr"> 318 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Read it? The entire thing was a private joke between the two of us.’</span>

<span id="L320" class="LineNr"> 320 </span><span class="htmlItalic">A….joke?</span>
<span id="L321" class="LineNr"> 321 </span>
<span id="L322" class="LineNr"> 322 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Yes. We used to drink together as youngsters, you see? And one day, your grandfather got drunk and said, “Wouldn’t it be hilarious if all the major religions – Samanism, Shivasim and Adamite - were founded in today’s age of knowledge and increased technology?” That is, if our so-called First Ancestors had science at their disposal when they had their revelation, would it still prove to be that - a revelation? Or merely a subjective experience that had no business being committed to paper, much less influence our daily lives for thousands of years thereafter? Without the magic and mystery, would those words still count? Or will our better senses born from reason shirk it, dismiss it for the nonsense that it is? That is the question. I said that we would. He said no, that humanity will always clutch to convenience of well-resolved stories that comfort the masses, that people didn’t mind if this myth came at a time when our ancestors were learning to use primitive tools or if it was revealed at a time when we have technology at our behest.’ </span>
<span id="L323" class="LineNr"> 323 </span>
<span id="L324" class="LineNr"> 324 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I didn’t understand what you just said, sir. </span>
<span id="L325" class="LineNr"> 325 </span>
<span id="L326" class="LineNr"> 326 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The old man laughed, ‘The point is, young Master Mahasen, is that your grandfather and I made a bet. He wrote A History of Time and Time Again to prove that a plausible alternative creation myth can be written in this day and age, and sold to the masses using technology. If his political career hadn’t picked up like it did, he just might have published the book and pursued that goal. Who knows what would have happened then? He could have ended up a religious martyr – instead of a mere political one.’ </span>
<span id="L327" class="LineNr"> 327 </span>
<span id="L328" class="LineNr"> 328 </span><span class="htmlItalic">For the rest of the afternoon, Dev listened to Rejog’s ranting about the need for science and reason to supersede mythology and superstition, and aim, quite literally, for the stars. ‘Here’s proof: while we Miragians pontificate about us being the chosen people of this omnipotent Maternal Being who lives on the moon, fight among ourselves for this tiny oasis between a vast arid desert in the east and an endless sheet of sand in the south, those Circadians – do you know what those men have done?’ </span>
<span id="L329" class="LineNr"> 329 </span>
<span id="L330" class="LineNr"> 330 </span><span class="htmlItalic">No, sir. </span>

<span id="L332" class="LineNr"> 332 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘They’ve gone to the moon’, he said the words slowly. ‘They’ve walked on its surface!’ Dev, still orienting himself from the effect of Ana’s eyes, was devastated. This was too much to bear. </span>
<span id="L333" class="LineNr"> 333 </span>
<span id="L334" class="LineNr"> 334 </span><span class="htmlItalic">But Mother Mirage chose us! We should be on the moon. </span>
<span id="L335" class="LineNr"> 335 </span>
<span id="L336" class="LineNr"> 336 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘It is because they are unbelievers, my boy. They looked at these holy scripts like our Book of Mirage and saw no message was intended for them. If the First Ancestors did in fact exist, the Circadians told themselves, then they didn’t evidently give a fart about them. So they decided to go at it on their own. And they went looking for truth through science. And you know what else they found?’ </span>

We came from the stars and through years of creating and destroying, through fire and water, as fish and mammal, as ape and then as men before we adopt an identity as Samanian, Shivaputra or Adamite. We are all star dust, made from the same building blocks that gave life to the tree that was felled so that they can make the chair you are sitting on right now.’ </span>
<span id="L341" class="LineNr"> 341 </span>
<span id="L342" class="LineNr"> 342 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ana, seated by Dev’s side, turned towards him, hoping her eyes would meet his, and comfort this boy who was unaccustomed to her grandfather’s ramblings. </span>

<span id="L344" class="LineNr"> 344 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Today is my birthday. </span>
<span id="L345" class="LineNr"> 345 </span>
<span id="L346" class="LineNr"> 346 </span><span class="htmlItalic">This caught even the quick-witted Rejog by surprise. ‘Oh my sweet boy. Happy birthday.’ </span>

<span id="L348" class="LineNr"> 348 </span><span class="htmlItalic">We don’t celebrate my birthday. </span>

<span id="L350" class="LineNr"> 350 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Why not?’ asked Ana. </span>

<span id="L352" class="LineNr"> 352 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Ana, stop being so inquisit –‘ </span>
<span id="L353" class="LineNr"> 353 </span>
<span id="L354" class="LineNr"> 354 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Because my mother died giving birth to me. </span>
<span id="L355" class="LineNr"> 355 </span>
<span id="L356" class="LineNr"> 356 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The old man sighed. </span>
<span id="L357" class="LineNr"> 357 </span>
<span id="L358" class="LineNr"> 358 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev was no longer looking at the floor. He turned towards Ana. </span>

<span id="L360" class="LineNr"> 360 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Can I celebrate my birthday with the two of you? </span>

<span id="L362" class="LineNr"> 362 </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">Rejog</span><span class="Green"> had Anaka run to the cafeteria and buy cake and sweets. An hour later Dev walked out of the library having celebrated his birthday </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> the first time, contemplating the immensity of Rejog’s knowledge, and infinity in Ana’s eyes, when the fireflies appeared. It was only dusk but they were already playing in the shadows by the bushes. Dev ran towards them like any child would. Were these minute beings as enchanted by this little human boy as he was by them? It appeared so because the fireflies let Deva join in their play. The hundreds that were there at that moment relayed this message of communion with a child of another species to the rest of the colony and they too joined, all ten thousand fireflies dancing around this little boy on the pavement of a narrow avenue. Was Rejog’s revelation of men walking on the moon alone responsible </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> planting that idea in the young Dev? Or was it the magical unity he felt with the fireflies that must share blame </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> the lunatic resolution – to live on the moon – he made to himself that day?&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic">  </span>
<span id="L363" class="LineNr"> 363 </span>
<span id="L364" class="LineNr"> 364 </span><span class="htmlItalic">It was six hours since school was done and Dev hadn’t still returned. It was in the midst of minor panic at the Mahasen household when Dev finally walked through the gates.  ‘And where have you been?’, Jara’s question was laced with resignation. </span>
<span id="L365" class="LineNr"> 365 </span>
<span id="L366" class="LineNr"> 366 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I was at the library. </span>

<span id="L369" class="LineNr"> 369 </span>
<span id="L370" class="LineNr"> 370 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I wanted to check something. </span>

<span id="L377" class="LineNr"> 377 </span>
<span id="L378" class="LineNr"> 378 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Grandpa’s book mentioned – </span>

<span id="L380" class="LineNr"> 380 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Oh for fuc – ‘, Jara stopped himself. He paused. ‘Do you know what today is?’ </span>

<span id="L382" class="LineNr"> 382 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev didn’t respond. </span>

<span id="L393" class="LineNr"> 393 </span>
<span id="L394" class="LineNr"> 394 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev looked around the hall. Manal was looking towards him, willing him to remember. Hasyl was openly enjoying this. Ohiy remained unmoving at the foot of the stairs. ‘You don’t remember?’ </span>

<span id="L396" class="LineNr"> 396 </span><span class="htmlItalic">No. </span>

<span id="L400" class="LineNr"> 400 </span>
<span id="L401" class="LineNr"> 401 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev remained quiet. </span>
<span id="L402" class="LineNr"> 402 </span>
<span id="L403" class="LineNr"> 403 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Are you going to talk?’ </span>
<span id="L404" class="LineNr"> 404 </span>
<span id="L405" class="LineNr"> 405 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I was celebrating my birthday in the library. </span>
<span id="L406" class="LineNr"> 406 </span>
<span id="L407" class="LineNr"> 407 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘With who?’</span>
<span id="L408" class="LineNr"> 408 </span>
<span id="L409" class="LineNr"> 409 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Friends, father. </span>
<span id="L410" class="LineNr"> 410 </span>
<span id="L411" class="LineNr"> 411 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘You don’t have friends, little brother’, Hasyl said. ‘You watch your fucking mouth, I’ve told you’, Manal moved towards Hasyl; it was only Jara’s glare that stopped him. Jara turned towards Dev again. ‘You see this? Your family is fighting instead of celebrating the memory of your mother. Are you happy now?’ Ohiy had had enough: ‘Jara - Mr Mahasen, I’ll speak to the boy. Please he is only a – ‘</span>
<span id="L412" class="LineNr"> 412 </span>
<span id="L413" class="LineNr"> 413 </span><span class="htmlItalic">It isn’t my fault!</span>
<span id="L414" class="LineNr"> 414 </span>
<span id="L415" class="LineNr"> 415 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘What did you say?’</span>
<span id="L416" class="LineNr"> 416 </span>
<span id="L417" class="LineNr"> 417 </span><span class="htmlItalic">All of you – you look at me like I am the reason there is so much misery in this house. It isn’t my fault! I am leaving. </span>
<span id="L418" class="LineNr"> 418 </span>
<span id="L419" class="LineNr"> 419 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘And where will you go?’ </span>
<span id="L420" class="LineNr"> 420 </span>
<span id="L421" class="LineNr"> 421 </span><span class="htmlItalic">It was then a strong gust of wind blew into the hall from an open window, gently tugged the drawn curtains apart, and revealed the full moon over the skies of Mirage. And Dev, pointing at the moon, announced then, that, father, that will be my home one day, and Jara sighed like fathers do and said, ‘Miragians are meant for the earth, son, not for the skies’. </span>
<span id="L422" class="LineNr"> 422 </span>
<span id="L423" class="LineNr"> 423 </span><span class="htmlItalic">But it was the fireflies.  </span>

<span id="L427" class="LineNr"> 427 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ten thousand fireflies showed me my fate lies on the moon.</span>

<span id="L431" class="LineNr"> 431 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Does it matter? We are all insects. The fate of fireflies is to eat. Ours is to dream. </span>
<span id="L432" class="LineNr"> 432 </span>
<span id="L433" class="LineNr"> 433 </span><span class="htmlItalic">His father sighed, ‘Your fate will be your brothers’, your brothers’ fate will be yours, your fate will be the same as mine and your grandfather’s: Our fate is in the hands of the people of Mirage. Our fate – your fate, Dev – will be in those ballot boxes - not on the moon. Do you understand? Happy birthday. Go to sleep. Good night.’ </span>

<span id="L436" class="LineNr"> 436 </span>
<span id="L437" class="LineNr"> 437 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Over the next ten years Jara set in motion plans that would make him the most powerful politician in modern Miragian history. It started when he was offered the Ministry of Labour. The media applauded: this, they said, was a fitting role </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">for</span><span class="Green"> a man whose family had profoundly and irrevocably altered the landscape of the ministry’s remit decades ago&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> that would prepare him for the inevitable: his candidacy for Presidency in five years’ time. By then His Excellency President Jaruna Abey would have completed his second term – the old man had had enough of politics. Jara would be the obvious candidate for succession.   </span>
<span id="L438" class="LineNr"> 438 </span>
<span id="L439" class="LineNr"> 439 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Upon taking up his duties, Jara gave an interview to the Miragian which left no doubt in readers’ minds of his political ambitions, displaying for his future electorate his everyman credentials. </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">That</span><span class="Green"> his ideas – and even the </span><span class="Aqua">language</span><span class="Green"> used - were ‘borrowed’ and adapted from the labour policies of the ultra-left leaning Circadian President of the time, His Excellency Stannel Paras Mead, was </span><span class="Aqua">left</span><span class="Green"> unsaid in the papers. ‘That any Miragian citizen should receive less than a comfortable living age as regular payment </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> their industriousness, that we still refer to a broad spectrum of our working population in as crass a phrase as “sweated trades”, that we allow little organization, little bargaining power to these most necessary trades, these are not signs of progress, but a condition of progressive degeneration.’&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> His proposal to create a Miragian Wages Board to enforce higher minimum wages in six industries </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">printing</span><span class="Green">, civil administration, fisheries, agriculture, military and paper mills&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> almost single-handedly assured victories for the Miragian Workers’ Party at every provincial and state elections, leading to the all-important Presidential Elections. With no rival within the party to contest him for nomination, the Miragian Workers’ Party unanimously voted Jara Mahasen as their candidate for the Presidential Elections of ’09. </span>
<span id="L440" class="LineNr"> 440 </span>
<span id="L441" class="LineNr"> 441 </span><span class="htmlItalic">That is when the nightmare overflowed from the tarred depths of his sleep. He was on stage waving to his supporters when a voice in his head posed questions: What if they want to kill you too, Jara? What assurance do you have that your father’s fate won’t be yours? You walk in the path he paved for you; is it not natural that you would face the same perils too? The speech that day was a disaster; his head scrambled, Jara mumbled platitudes that left the crowd bored. A number of his entourage on stage was photographed asleep. That image was plastered on the front page of The Miragian under an almost mocking headline the next day: Was Jara too overwhelmed by the expectations, the headline asked. </span>
<span id="L442" class="LineNr"> 442 </span>
<span id="L443" class="LineNr"> 443 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Jara excused himself from the breakfast table surrounded by his political advisors, spending minutes on his knees vomiting into the toilet. He promised himself that he would answer the insolent editor’s question in a resounding manner. Jara delivered impassioned speeches at every stage, in towns and villages, thereafter. The same writer compared Jara’s oratory skills to his legendary father’s. </span>
<span id="L444" class="LineNr"> 444 </span>
<span id="L445" class="LineNr"> 445 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Inside, however, Jara’s mind found new ways to poke at this fear of being assassinated. When people waved at him, he imagined one of those hands would belong to a skill knife-thrower who would use this sea of limbs as cover to carry out his contract. He had to stop his hands from shivering when he was told by his advisors to mingle with the common folk. Even their apparent adoration was not enough to convince him. While shaking hands, kissing the foreheads of toddlers, and consoling sickly old men and women one day, Jara had to summon all his strength to stop himself from urinating in nervous fright. But this conflict of circumstance and spirit, this inability to resolve his personal fears with his deepest ambition, manifested itself most damagingly in his rare moments at home. He barely spent any time with Ella who had lost all mental and physical control of herself and her body. Following his nomination, a photo-op with his iconic mother was arranged for by The Miragian. As the photographer fixed their pose, he sniffed at the air. Jara got the smell too: his mother had shit herself.  Embarrassed and angry, Jara excused himself from the room and didn’t pay a visit to his mother’s chambers for months thereafter. Ohiy understood why: he didn’t want the anger to be directed at his mother. Instead it was channelled towards his eldest and youngest sons. </span>
<span id="L446" class="LineNr"> 446 </span>
<span id="L447" class="LineNr"> 447 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Manal had long given up trying to please his father. He returned from a six month stay in Circadia a different man, buoyed by the cultural revolutions taking place there. </span>
<span id="L448" class="LineNr"> 448 </span>
<span id="L449" class="LineNr"> 449 </span><span class="htmlItalic">What’s that you are smoking?</span>
<span id="L450" class="LineNr"> 450 </span>
<span id="L451" class="LineNr"> 451 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Manal looked at his brother, now 17, and after a pause offered him the paper cone-like stick stuffed </span>
<span id="L452" class="LineNr"> 452 </span><span class="htmlItalic">with the green herb he was smoking.</span>
<span id="L453" class="LineNr"> 453 </span>

<span id="L457" class="LineNr"> 457 </span><span class="htmlItalic">  </span>
<span id="L458" class="LineNr"> 458 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev hesitated. </span>

<span id="L460" class="LineNr"> 460 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Come on, I am your older brother. I am not going to give you something dangerous.’ </span>
<span id="L461" class="LineNr"> 461 </span><span class="htmlItalic">What does it do?</span>
<span id="L462" class="LineNr"> 462 </span>
<span id="L463" class="LineNr"> 463 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Depends. For me, it pauses time – everything is still and calm, like a photograph. The older you get, the faster time seems to roll. Fast’, he snapped his fingers. ‘One day you are 18, playing the role of the perfect eldest child – and then you smoke this, sit back and wonder why the fuck you are doing anything for anyone besides yourself. Point is I realized I don’t want to play the role of the perfect son.’ </span>

Brooding on the inside, cheerful on the out, he knew little besides the political landscape of Mirage. That changed the day he met Nnae, the daughter of the Circadian ambassador.

When she slipped into the greenhouse in the backyard, Manal was already there but managed a genuine look of surprise when she stepped in. </span>

<span id="L550" class="LineNr"> 550 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Want to listen?’ Manal nodded. He was a decent musician, but not a passionate one. Miragian music didn’t stir anything inside of him. </span>
<span id="L551" class="LineNr"> 551 </span>
<span id="L552" class="LineNr"> 552 </span><span class="htmlItalic">But Manal had never heard anything like the music of Circadia before. The Circadians, unlike Miragians, wrote music to match the full spectrum of the human condition, Nnae said. ‘I mean, to have at your disposal a tool as perfectly suited to hold a mirror to humanity’s joys and sorrows but not to use it to represent our anger, our misanthropy, our undiluted hate even - isn’t that a waste?’ </span>
<span id="L553" class="LineNr"> 553 </span>
<span id="L554" class="LineNr"> 554 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Manal agreed with Nnae’s reasoning. In fact, he was smitten – by the music and by this Circadian priestess who seemed to invoke her country’s music with a mere press of a button. She invited him over to the house the next day for an extended listening session. In this manner, Nnae introduced Manal to music and musicians of such varied complexity and texture and moods that he wondered, If this is how much of music is deprived to a typical Miragian, how much of truth is being held back, moulded differently to meet the motives of Miragians rulers?</span>

<span id="L556" class="LineNr"> 556 </span><span class="htmlItalic">He still entertained a healthy sexual desire for her but hadn’t acted on it for fearing of losing this sole contact to a different world. Nnae, realizing his predicament, decided to follow the advice of a friend: she’d offer Manal a puff of the herb Kanab, the bud of which was said to have aphrodisiac properties.  </span>
<span id="L557" class="LineNr"> 557 </span>
<span id="L558" class="LineNr"> 558 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘What’s this?’ Manal asked when he was presented with his first joint. </span>

<span id="L562" class="LineNr"> 562 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘I don’t smoke.’ </span>

<span id="L569" class="LineNr"> 569 </span>
<span id="L570" class="LineNr"> 570 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Manal felt a great intensity of connecting to the music of that day. A man, armed with guitar and a voice scarred by tobacco, sang a rambunctious tune about a legendary nymph called The Black Widow to who married men would turn when they had grown tired of their wives. The Black Widow demanded only one thing in return for a night of unspeakable pleasures: the complete submission of the man – his body, mind and soul – at the altar of her bed. I am yours, prey on me the man begged her in verse. Nnae kissed Manal’s cheek then, but the texture of the kiss quickly transformed before he could react. Her tongue traced its way up his cheek and to his ear lobe. The song too was evolving, a woman’s voice provided the song’s lyrical counterpoint: The Black Widow weaves, tonight she weaves on ye. Nnae sang, whisper-singing the refrain She weaves on ye. She took his right hand, licked each finger and guided the wet finger tips under her skirt. His fingers plunged into her moist, warm flesh. She yelped and held him back. ‘Gently’, she rebuked. With her hands grasping his wrist, she guided him in, helping Manal finding the right rhythm. It took a while but the effect of the Kanab and the music made him increasingly confident. Soon there was song from her again, but this time she wasn’t singing along to The Black Widow; no, this was her own song, sung in some primordial tongue, of different timbres and tones indecipherable to him; where the tempo changed from aimless, plodding wistfulness to possessed pacing and guttural moans. Nnae’s body arched, her head snapped backwards, mouth agape, she held his wrist even tighter, plunging his index and ring finger deeper into herself. Manal’s aching fingers felt the warm wetness of a woman in uncontrollable climax. Her body writhed and her skin rippled. Loosening her grip on his wrist, Nnae fell like a puppet whose strings had been cut. She lifted her skirt and spread her legs wider. ‘I am not done weaving on you. Remember’, she whispered into his ear as he hurriedly entered her: </span>

<span id="L580" class="LineNr"> 580 </span><span class="htmlItalic">They were loud and messy that afternoon. It would have been a scandal had it not been raining so hard that the gardening staff had left their duties for the day, leaving the couple to explore the entirety of the greenhouse as they explored each other’s bodies. Exhausted, they were on the floor, still naked, little petals and soil sticking to their sweaty bodies. Nnae broke the news then: ‘I am going back to Circadia for the holidays’, she said as she mounted him again, guiding his hands to her hips this time. ‘Come with me.’ </span>

<span id="L584" class="LineNr"> 584 </span><span class="htmlItalic">At that moment in a different part of Mirage, as Manal considered going to this Circadian woman’s homeland, Hasyl’s name was called to come up on stage and receive his Lieutenant Commission. He had graduated top of his class and was weeks away from starting duties as Special Assistant to General Facēnos, the Commander of the Miragian Army. His father stood beaming on stage. ‘Good lad’, Jara said, lowering his voice as father and son shook hands in front of an adoring audience. ‘You’ve done well.’ </span>
<span id="L585" class="LineNr"> 585 </span>
<span id="L586" class="LineNr"> 586 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Hasyl was ten when he watched his grandfather blown to pieces live on Miragian Vision. He ran close to the screen as the camera, shaken by the sheer force of the blast, desperately sought to capture the happenings on the now damaged stage. Where is father? Father?! The camera was in frenzy still as the terrified crowd ran amok, screaming for their lives and loved ones. A man walked in front of the camera, his spectacles shattered like a sheet of ice, his clothes torn, blood dripping from countless shards of glass that had ripped into his skin. I can’t hear anything. Please. I can’t hear anything the dazed man cried.  No one else was in the living room as the Mahasen boys watched Miragian history and personal tragedy write itself. Ohiy stormed into the living room then: ‘What in the name of Mother Mirage are you two doing? I’ve been calling you for dinner for the last five mi – ‘</span>
<span id="L587" class="LineNr"> 587 </span>
<span id="L588" class="LineNr"> 588 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The camera had now regained its orientation. Its focus was on a decapitated head of Yara Mahasen. ‘- oh please, no!’ She switched off the screen. ‘Miss Ohiy, no!’ Hasyl protested. ‘I want to see if father is hurt.’ Ohiy’s hands shook. Ella walked into the room then. ‘What’s going on?’ A strange gnawing. ‘What’, Ella began, ‘What did they show on Vision?’ Ohiy and the two boys were speechless. ‘Tell me. Ohiy?’ she stood directly in front of Ohiy. ‘Step aside then.’ Ella turned on the VS. </span>

It is now time to state the obvious: This Miragian history is patently false. The time of the so-called noble blooded is coming to an end. Yesterday we said our farewell to a true Miragian hero. He wasn’t born of noble blood. He was born in a home like ours. His worries were ours, our worries his. He was us. He was a hero and a true Miragian patriot - and if history is just it will record him as one. Yesterday the nation cremated this great Miragian but it will not allow his memory to pass. It must not. His work must continue. His vision must come true. May he Rest in Peace. EXCERPT FROM THE BIRTH OF THE MAHASEN ERA, The Miragian, BY JARLAP, A (3092[2592], October 10), pp. A1, A4&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> Hasyl never forgot the intimacy of that moment – and was secretly thankful to the brave photographer for daring to capture it. After Yami died giving birth to Dev three months later, Hasyl visited his school library to seek out this issue of The Miragian. There, as the librarian stood helpless, Hasyl cut out the photograph from the library’s copy and took the clipping home. </span>
<span id="L591" class="LineNr"> 591 </span>
<span id="L592" class="LineNr"> 592 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Grief hung over the Mahasen home. Friends remarked among themselves that laughter, curiosity, surprise and joy would have left the Mahasen spirit completely had it not been for the infant Dev. All members of the Mahasen household gravitated towards the baby, seeking solace from their grief, except Jara and Hasyl. One day Hasyl walked by Dev’s nursery and heard his infant brother awake and crying. No one was in the room at the time. Hasyl entered the room and watched the tiny creature who not so much cried but screamed like a hundred terrified birds. He was a month old and this was the first time Hasyl had seen him properly. Why Hasyl asked the insolent creature did you have to come in and ruin everything? The question Hasyl posed the infant was built on the strength of his ten-year-old sense of logic: mother left this home and father to prepare for your arrival – our perfect family will no longer be whole without mother – your arrival killed mother – therefore you are to be blamed. For everything, little brother. Hasyl left the room, leaving his infant brother to cry. This silly assertion, that an infant was to blame for his family’s fate to forever court tragedy, would have died a natural death as he became older and wiser; instead Hasyl made the error of allowing the wound to fester, infecting other parts of his psyche. Hasyl’s anger turned into hate when he realized Manal was growing closer to, and protective of, the infant. It was this malady that convinced Jara to send his favourite son to military school so that he could reign in the rage before it was too late. </span>
<span id="L593" class="LineNr"> 593 </span>
<span id="L594" class="LineNr"> 594 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘You know why you must go?’ Jara asked Hasyl the night before he was to leave for military school. Hasyl nodded. ‘You know what you must do?’ Again, Hasyl nodded. </span>
<span id="L595" class="LineNr"> 595 </span>
<span id="L596" class="LineNr"> 596 </span><span class="htmlItalic">When his two eldest sons were in their mid-teens, Jara knew who would become the politician and who would play the prodigal one. Manal was too open to ideas, not tethered to the vision of a Mahasen hegemony as Hasyl showed all the inclinations of being.  Hasyl was, on the other hand, obedient to his father’s every bidding, and knew why a certain thing was said – without any great pontificating on Jara’s part on the need to be moored to the family’s way, his way. But the anger threatened to derail Hasyl’s obvious aptitude for climbing the ladder. It was over an afternoon cup of tea with General Facēnos when the latter put forward the suggestion. Jara found the idea agreeable from the outset. Hasyl, too, agreed without hesitation when he was asked if he would consider a military career.  That phase of the plan was now in its fruition. </span>
<span id="L597" class="LineNr"> 597 </span>
<span id="L598" class="LineNr"> 598 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Good lad. You’ve done well’, Jara repeated to Hasyl, looking at him straight in the eye.

If the chieftain was on the side of good and engaged in battle purely in the defence of his tribe then Odonata would respond to the call and defeat his enemies.’</span>

When the song was done, The Old Man said, “I commanded all the world to sing an ode for ye, fair Sta. The world is at my feet. I am at thine. Be mine and thy beauty will be ageless from this moment!” Instead of being seduced by this act, Sta is left terrified. She refuses his advances despite knowing that this was the lord of all gods. The Great Unknown then whisks her away to his celestial abode and rapes her. When Chief Ruku hears of this, he orders all the temples built in The Great Unknown’s name to be burnt to the ground. This angers The Great Unknown who descends into the Circadian realms with the bruised Sta by his side. The Great Unknown burns every man, woman and child in Ruku’s tribe, making the helpless chief watch as each member of his tribe disintegrated in to ashes. The desperate Chief Ruku invokes Odonata then: “I beseech thee, warrior maiden. Aid us and we will forever be thy most devout servants.” The Great Unknown was Odonata’s great-great-great grandfather, but she was a kind and just Goddess, and not one to refuse her cosmic responsibility. She rode to meet The Old Man in battle. Upon seeing Odonata challenge him, The Old Man laughed so hard that the sky turned grey and it started raining and didn’t stop for another hundred years thereafter. Incensed, Odonata charged at him, her sword stopping inches from The Old Man’s face. The Great Unknown hadn’t moved. He smiles evilly at her instead. “Thou art the patriarch of all living things, Great Father! Please! I beseech thee: let these people live, set Sta free”, she begs him. The Old Man continues to smile menacingly. In tears, Odonata called on all her strength and plunged the sword into The Old Man’s face. Nothing happens to The Old Man, but Chief Ruku watches in horror as Odonata is sucked in, sword-first, into the unfathomable depths of The Great Unknown’s black eyes. The Old Man then spat her out. Cocooned in his saliva, Odonata’s form had changed. She was no longer the beautiful virgin warrior goddess. She was an insect unlike anything seen before. She had been turned into a dragonfly.  And that, Dev’, Anaka said, ‘is how I got my middle name, Odonata. Anaka-Odonata Ziromt.’ </span>

<span id="L614" class="LineNr"> 614 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev found himself lost in her again. Ten years had passed since he first met Anaka and her eccentric grandfather in an empty library. Ten years and it seemed everyday he found new reasons to go weak in her presence – and new ways of not being able to tell her the one truth. </span>

<span id="L616" class="LineNr"> 616 </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">Dev</span><span class="Green"> would grapple all his life with this concept of ‘The One Truth’. At seven, fermenting in his grandfather’s novel take on Miragian mythology, Dev’s submission </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> his school short story competition, titled ‘The War of the Shapes’, focussed on a fight </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> geometric superiority; essentially which </span><span class="Aqua">shape</span><span class="Green"> was the most important </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> the sane functioning of the mortal world. The shapes fight one another in order to gain the affection of man. In the final battle, the Circle emerges as victor because man realizes it had always been, and always will be, the circle that best captured the geometry of his own fate. At seventeen, Dev penned a poem in three parts titled, ‘The One Truth’. In the poem he imagines the world anew, sans human presence except </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> Anaka and he, a world in genesis that they were tasked to populate with their progeny. The poem sets the scene of this new, virgin world, creates Dev and Anaka from the ashes of exploding stars, and charts their individual journeys over mountains, through swamps, and across deserts, in search of one another. When they finally find each other on </span><span class="Aqua">top</span><span class="Green"> of a hill they realize, that in their haste to seek the other out, neither knew to speak. Unable to communicate their love </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> one another, they spend the rest of their lives quietly creating </span><span class="Aqua">language</span><span class="Green">, a Miragian tongue, so that they may finally utter ‘The One Truth’, their first utterance to one another. The poem’s devastating conclusion sees an old and weak Dev at Anaka’s deathbed. Grief-stricken and alone, unable to still put into words his loss, he finally blurts out the simple sentences he had spent his lifetime constructing, ‘The One Truth’: ‘I love you, Anaka. I have always loved you.’&gt;</span>

He sounded childlike in his disappointment. ‘That’s all’, Ana smiled but her voice was stern. ‘You are tougher to crack than your mother, Ana. Of that, there is no doubt.’ She kissed him on the cheek.  ‘Better’, Rejog said and smiled back. ‘You two can do as you wish. You don’t need to keep an old man company.’  ‘Does the old man wish to take his afternoon nap?’ The banter between grandfather and granddaughter was among the many things he enjoyed about their company. ‘The old man does wish to take his afternoon nap, yes.’ ‘That’s fine then’, Ana said and began to clear the table. ‘Dev, help me with these please?’ </span>

Dev led her to one of the small study halls that characterized the top floor of the library. He sat near as she silently wept.

On the first day – ‘Since you are a city boy we’ll start with a simple walk through the forest’ – the hike started after breakfast; it was mid-afternoon under a scorching sun when they returned.

Puncturing the ghostly curtain, Ana ran towards him, her face a grimace. Dev looked stupidly on as she got closer. Finally, she grabbed his arm and turned back towards the temple again. ‘Run, now!’ Ana made Dev run the last twenty stairs up to the temple. When they reached the summit, Dev fell to his feet, exhausted and panting heavily. Ana refused to let him be: ‘Stand up, Dev. Life is too short to miss this.’ She was right. Dev forgot the pain in his thighs and feet as he sighted the first ray of sunlight shoot out of the horizon.  The night black was replaced by a blue that itself was morphing into an orange. ‘What do you think? It is like someone lit a giant matchstick in the horizon, isn’t it?’ </span>

She walked towards the temple’s western walls. ‘This will be as magical.’ Again, she was right. Thousands of feet below the mountain’s western slopes, its shadow, a perfect triangle, crept along the carpet-like valley below. As the sun continued to ascend, the shadow stretched towards the furthest limits of Mirage. Like a giant arrowhead, the shadow pointed towards the eastern [Check on orientation. ][][][Is this right? ]borders of Mirage. ‘Beyond those rivers, there is Circadia[Is this right?].

Having their breakfasts were a dog, a cat, and a troupe of monkeys. Dev and Ana soon realized they were eating what meagre food the monk had for himself. Instead of chasing the offenders away, the monk patted the animals and let them continue eating.  He served the tea in two coconut shells. ‘What brings the two of you to the temple on such a day? The full moon isn’t due for another week and the temple priest isn’t here today.’ </span>
<span id="L772" class="LineNr"> 772 </span>
<span id="L773" class="LineNr"> 773 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘We are not here for the rituals, Brother’, Ana replied. ‘My friend Dev had never been here so I thought I’d show him the temple.’</span>

<span id="L786" class="LineNr"> 786 </span>
<span id="L787" class="LineNr"> 787 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘I was born there’, the monk replied. </span>

<span id="L797" class="LineNr"> 797 </span><span class="htmlItalic">You said that this was the greatest library in the world. What did you mean, Brother?</span>
<span id="L798" class="LineNr"> 798 </span>
<span id="L799" class="LineNr"> 799 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The question caught the monk by surprise. Ana reigned in a look of annoyance. ‘A library is a vessel of knowledge, is it not? But it asks us to rely on the minds of other men to attain this knowledge. After coming here, I’ve learnt that our own minds are in themselves one of the largest vessels of knowledge of the cosmos and our place in it, most of that knowledge is hidden too deep in our consciousness for us to attain. I have not attained that knowledge but I will – or I will die seeking it.’ </span>

<span id="L801" class="LineNr"> 801 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ana was done with her tea. Dev had barely drunk his. They said their farewells to the monk and prepared for their descent. The monk accompanied them to the stairs. ‘Thank you, my friends. Your company gave me great joy.’ </span>

<span id="L803" class="LineNr"> 803 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Thank you for your hospitality, Brother’, Ana said and began her walk down. </span>

<span id="L815" class="LineNr"> 815 </span><span class="htmlItalic">A sea of Miragians clapped, waved and shouted his campaign slogan, ‘A Brighter Future!’ as Jara Mahasen waved back at the crowd. This was his moment. This would be spoken about in decades to come as the beginning of the Mahasen era of modern Miragian politics. ‘Thank you!’ Jara’s voice echoed across the promenade through the public speakers. ‘Thank you. May Mother Mirage Bless Us All!’ The response was thunderous. If he listened hard enough, he could hear and separate the gruff voices of the men in the crowd from the excitement of the women; and they were all screaming his name. As he stepped down from the stairs of the Miragian State Assembly he saw a boy in the front row of the crowd pleading for Jara to come his way. He must be Dev’s age that boy Jara thought and made his way to the lad. ‘Please, President Mahasen. Please, sir. Photo please, sir’, he shouted over the din. Jara gestured his bodyguards to bring the boy towards him. Making his way over the railing, the guard motioned for the boy to spread his arms so that he may be body-checked, but the boy cut to the guard’s left, and before the latter could stop him, the boy, his face now cloaked in anger, ran up the stairs and towards Jara. It was too late to react. The boy jumped towards him. Jara thought he heard a click before the world cut to black. </span>
<span id="L816" class="LineNr"> 816 </span>
<span id="L817" class="LineNr"> 817 </span><span class="htmlItalic">There was ringing in his ears. When he put his finger in to try and clear the irritation, he felt the warm ooze of blood. He opened his eyes. There was smoke billowing besides him. Above, the sky hadn’t changed from the bright sunny day he remembered from a few minutes back. Wouldn’t these everyday miracles transform into monstrous manifestations of death’s coming? Is the sky still blue for the dead?  He moved his fingers; they responded. He moved his toes; they too were still attached. I am conscious, so my head is still...Jara tried to get up. It was difficult: his torso was buried under three other bodies. I am alive. How am I still alive? One by one, with what little energy he had left, Jara pushed aside the bodies and forced himself up. Had the bodyguards managed to somehow cover him from the force of the explosion? Smoke was still smouldering around him. Jara scanned the surroundings, looking for other survivors. Nothing moved around him except for a murder of crows circling above the mass of bodies and blood.  How am I still alive and everyone else dead?</span>
<span id="L818" class="LineNr"> 818 </span>
<span id="L819" class="LineNr"> 819 </span><span class="htmlItalic">One crow swooped down towards where the railings had stood a few minutes before. Jara eyed the errant bird, a voice in his head telling him what it was about to do. And the crow did exactly that: it hopped towards a body and pecked at the corpse’s eyes. Horrified, Jara ran down the steps towards the bird, but by now the other crows too had started to descend into this morbid buffet. Each seemed to prefer the eyes of the corpses. Jara watched one bird fly away with an eyeball between its beaks.  ‘Help! Somebody, help!’ Jara shouted. ‘Someone please help me!’ </span>
<span id="L820" class="LineNr"> 820 </span>
<span id="L821" class="LineNr"> 821 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Another bird landed on a corpse’s head, closer to Jara this time. The crow had its back turned from Jara. Time to time, it would bend down, peck at the eyes below its feet, and look up towards the horizon again[In the distance?]. Jara looked around: there was a pole at his feet. Picking it up, he swung at the unsuspecting bird. It had just bent towards the head to peck again when it felt the full brunt of Jara’s blow. Squawking in pain, the crow, unable to fly away, hobbled around in panic. Jara went after it, but then his brain recognized a familiar face in his peripheral vision. Jara turned to the corpse on which the crow had been feasting on. </span>
<span id="L822" class="LineNr"> 822 </span>
<span id="L823" class="LineNr"> 823 </span><span class="htmlItalic">That face. It can’t be. No. </span>
<span id="L824" class="LineNr"> 824 </span>
<span id="L825" class="LineNr"> 825 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The face, sans left eye-ball and bleeding from its mouth, sported a manic smile. No, No! This is not happening! Yara Mahasen’s face looked like he did the day he was butchered - as if that exact moment of his death had been captured by a master sculptor. ‘Remember, Jara: For a Brighter Future!’ Yara’s head cackled. ‘FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE!’ Jara closed his eyes as he felt the encroaching of madness, but the cries got louder still – ‘A BRIGHTER FUTURE!’ – like the volume of a PA speaker increased to unbearable levels. His curiosity getting the better of him, Jara opened his eyes. Around him were countless heads of Yara Mahasen, attached to the countless dead - men, women and children. They were all chorusing: ‘A BRIGHTER FUTURE!’  </span>
<span id="L826" class="LineNr"> 826 </span>
<span id="L827" class="LineNr"> 827 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Are you alright, Mr Mahasen?’ </span>

Manal had already served himself a plate and was eating. ‘Morning, Hasyl. Morning, Manal’, his tone changed between the two greetings betraying his views on his sons. Manal feigned politeness and mumbled the greeting back while chewing his food. ‘Where is Dev?’ His question was pointed towards Manal. Hasyl too looked in the direction of his older brother. Manal, still eating, took a while to register the eyes on him. ‘What?’ ‘Where is Dev?’ Jara repeated. ‘How’, Manal spoke slowly while munching a mouthful, ‘am I supposed to know the whereabouts of a seventeen year old? For all I know, he spends nights at the library.’ </span>
<span id="L868" class="LineNr"> 868 </span>
<span id="L869" class="LineNr"> 869 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ohiy walked in the midst of this tense exchange. ‘Can’t I leave you three in a room for five minutes and expect to come back to peace and quiet?’ ‘This is peace and quiet, Miss Ohiy’, Manal retorted. ‘Just an uneasy one.’ ‘Try harder at sounding a smartass, Manal. You’ll know when you do.’ ‘And how is that, Miss Ohiy?’ Manal was chuckling. ‘You’ll receive a thrashing from me at that point.’ The chuckling stopped. ‘Miss Ohiy, where is Dev?’ Jara interrupted. ‘He isn’t trying to miss today’s ceremony, is he?’ Ohiy motioned everyone to take their seats. She took her place at the table. ‘Dev is at Ana’s place.’ ‘Miss Ohiy’, Jara started. ‘He will be there at the ceremony. He promised’, Ohiy reassured him. ‘She’s leaving today, that girl.’ The breakfast was otherwise uneventful and completely devoid of conversation. When he was done, Jara’s secretary entered. ‘Sir, it is time.’ Jara stood and looked at the table. ‘I will see you all at the assembly today. Be on time.’ Hasyl stood and saluted, ‘Good luck, father.’ </span>

I will see you smile and be polite to all those important people who will sit around you. And, above all, I won’t – and let me repeat this so it goes through your thick skull – I won’t see you carrying a camera. Is that clear?’ Manal nodded. Jara stormed out.

<span id="L890" class="LineNr"> 890 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Or else? Or else what, Hasyl?’ he realized then he no longer had any physical advantage over his younger brother. ‘You think that fucking uniform allows you to say whatever the fuck you want?’</span>

<span id="L904" class="LineNr"> 904 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Rejog’s condition worsened in the weeks leading to Jara’s election triumph. Ana and her mother divided their time in taking care of the old man’s needs. Dev was in class one afternoon when he received an urgent message from Ana: ‘Grandpa is asking for you. Pls come soon.’ Rushing to the Ziromt residence, Dev found Ana and her mother, Tysa, anxious outside Rejog’s room. ‘He’s been asking for you all day’, Ana said before she opened the door to Rejog’s room. ‘Try to sound normal. He’ll snap if he hears any sympathy.’ Dev closed the door behind and stood near it for a while. Rejog had thinned considerably. His breathing was raspy. Most of the curtains were drawn, but sunlight crept through a narrow opening and was bathing the left side of his face. </span>

<span id="L934" class="LineNr"> 934 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘I was in love with your grandmother, Dev. I am still in love with Ella.’ He paused, giving Dev a moment to let the jolt soak in. If he was surprised, Dev didn’t let his hands betray it. Rejog continued, ‘I fell in love with your grandmother the day Yara introduced me to her as his future wife. I tried to ignore that first moment when I lost myself in her eyes, I tried to put it to the back of my mind, bury it like the cancer that it was. I should have been happy for Yara. Instead, I drunk myself silly and entered the greatest brothel in all of Mirage and didn’t leave for two days – until I was sure I had exorcised that first memory of Ella. They got married. And then he got into trouble because of those protests. Nothing, Dev, nothing has angered me more in life than seeing them treat Yara and Ella like that. The police, those scum beat them like animals. Like animals, Dev. I knew Yara was prepared for this, but Ella – she was only a teenager then. I tried to get them out. I tried, Dev. I tried everything, but the government wouldn’t do anything until the uprising of the working-class was quelled. On the day they were to be set free, I drove to the prisons to pick them up. First to Yara and then to Ella. I was so happy to see Yara again. We were waiting for an hour outside the women’s prison when the doors finally opened. And there she was. Your grandmother bearing a child. Prison ruins the spirit, Dev. I’ve seen it. My father spent a year in prison and when he came back, we barely recognized him. Not, Ella’s spirit. Not your grandmother’s. She now had the maternal glow. I realized before we all got into the car that I had never stopped loving Ella, that I had been in denial all along. Everyday thereafter was a battle between the demons of my heart and cold logic of my mind. Little by little, as Yara became more and more powerful a politician, I stopped visiting them. It was, in my mind, the only course of action. Even with hindsight, I do not think I would do anything differently. I loved your grandfather, Dev, but I loved Ella more. Instead of choosing one or the other, I deprived myself of both. Your grandfather thought I stopped talking and associating with him because of his politics. “You rich prick!”, he shouted on the day he finally confronted me about my distancing myself from him. “You rich boys, you sit back and there is money being made in your name, enough wealth to last generations. But here I am trying to come up, change my destiny, change Mirage’s destiny so that people from my background don’t have to suffer as I did - and you won’t have it, Rejog! You are an envious, rich cunt who doesn’t want to show other envious, rich cunts that you have anything to do with a dirty low-born commoner like me!” He stormed off. I did nothing to stop him. We never spoke again.’  Rejog was weeping. Dev wiped the Rejog’s tears away. </span>
<span id="L935" class="LineNr"> 935 </span>
<span id="L936" class="LineNr"> 936 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Would you like to talk to my grandmother?</span>
<span id="L937" class="LineNr"> 937 </span>
<span id="L938" class="LineNr"> 938 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘I see her in my dreams every night, Dev. I got married, had a daughter, a granddaughter who is the shining beacon of all the joy in my life, but every night Ella haunts my dreams. She haunts me to this day. She was the unattainable one. Ella. Ella. Ella’, tears continued to pour down. ‘My dying wish, Dev, is that I tell her the one thing I know to be true ever since the day I met her.’ </span>
<span id="L939" class="LineNr"> 939 </span>
<span id="L940" class="LineNr"> 940 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Stop crying. Please. I’ll bring aach to you. </span>
<span id="L941" class="LineNr"> 941 </span>
<span id="L942" class="LineNr"> 942 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ana and Tysa were waiting outside the room when Dev finally walked out. He sat them down and repeated what Rejog had told him. They greeted the news with surprising ease. ‘I’ve always known there was someone else he longed for’, Tysa said when Dev was done. ‘Reading his work when I was an adult, it is fairly obvious none of it was inspired by mother.’  </span>
<span id="L943" class="LineNr"> 943 </span>
<span id="L944" class="LineNr"> 944 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev rushed back home. He knew the only way he could get his grandmother to travel was to let Ohiy arrange the whole thing. His first task was then to convince Ohiy. When Ohiy recovered from Dev’s telling of the story, she beckoned the nurse and told her what needed to be done. With the nurse’s help, Ohiy bathed and dressed Ella. Within the hour, Ohiy, Ella and the nurse were in the family car being driven to Ana’s home. Throughout Ella was particularly cooperative though she had no idea where she was being taken.  It was at the Ziromt hall that Ella froze. Her attention was grabbed by a photograph. No one said a word as they saw the Mahasen matriarch grapple with her memory, coaxing it to remember the faces in the photo. Dev stepped closer to her. </span>
<span id="L945" class="LineNr"> 945 </span>
<span id="L946" class="LineNr"> 946 </span><span class="htmlItalic">That’s you and paataach on the right.</span>
<span id="L947" class="LineNr"> 947 </span>
<span id="L948" class="LineNr"> 948 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Yes, it is.’ </span>
<span id="L949" class="LineNr"> 949 </span>
<span id="L950" class="LineNr"> 950 </span><span class="htmlItalic">He looks very handsome, aach.</span>
<span id="L951" class="LineNr"> 951 </span>
<span id="L952" class="LineNr"> 952 </span><span class="htmlItalic">She giggled, almost girl-like. ‘But this man...I know him too.’ </span>
<span id="L953" class="LineNr"> 953 </span>
<span id="L954" class="LineNr"> 954 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Yes, you do. That’s – </span>
<span id="L955" class="LineNr"> 955 </span>
<span id="L956" class="LineNr"> 956 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘- that’s Rejog!’ she exclaimed, glowing in the aftermath of having won this battle with her fading memory. </span>
<span id="L957" class="LineNr"> 957 </span>
<span id="L958" class="LineNr"> 958 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Would you like to see him? </span>
<span id="L959" class="LineNr"> 959 </span>
<span id="L960" class="LineNr"> 960 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Yes! It’s been years since I saw Rejog. He hardly visits anymore[Barely comes to visit? Or he barely visits. ].’ </span>
<span id="L961" class="LineNr"> 961 </span>
<span id="L962" class="LineNr"> 962 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev guided Ella into Rejog’s room. The old man was lying down exactly as Dev had left him, but there was a thin, dusty manuscript left unopened by his bed table now.  ‘Ella?’ Rejog’s voice sounded different to when Dev had heard earlier in the afternoon. ‘Rejog, is that really you?’ </span>
<span id="L963" class="LineNr"> 963 </span>
<span id="L964" class="LineNr"> 964 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Yes it’s me. It’s Rejog. Come here, Ella.’ </span>
<span id="L965" class="LineNr"> 965 </span>
<span id="L966" class="LineNr"> 966 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev led Ella to the seat and sat her down. Ana, meanwhile, adjusting Rejog’s blanket asked if he needed anything else: ‘Yes. Leave us.’ No one was prepared for this. ‘Now’, Rejog’s voice was more insistent.  Ohiy nodded her head to Dev, Tysa beckoned Ana; they closed the door lightly. </span>
<span id="L967" class="LineNr"> 967 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Hours went by. From time to time, Ohiy or Tysa would open the door, taking care to not make a sound, and peep their heads in to ensure the Rejog and Ella were okay. Ana peeped in at one time and returned to the rest of the party sporting a smile on her face: ‘I heard laughter - from both of them.’ It was late around dinner time when Rejog called for Tysa.  As Ohiy and Dev went by Ella’s sides to help her up, she laid her hands on Rejog’s chest. Finding the hand, he lifted it to his face and kissed it. ‘Stay for a minute, Dev’, Rejog said as the party dispersed. ‘I need to give you something.’ When the room was empty again, Rejog motioned towards the dusty manuscript that was on his bed table. ‘That, Dev’, Rejog began, ‘is everything I wrote for Ella when I fell in love with your grandmother. Writing it was the only reason I didn’t descend into madness. I want you to have it. It’s yours now.’ </span>
<span id="L968" class="LineNr"> 968 </span>
<span id="L969" class="LineNr"> 969 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘And, Dev?’ He was at the door and turned back to Rejog. ‘Give her time. Ana doesn’t like cages. You do. Give her time and she’ll come around. Not now.’ Dev opened the manuscript on his way back home. It was titled ‘The Ghost Orchid: An Anthology of Poems for The Unattainable One’.</span>
<span id="L970" class="LineNr"> 970 </span>
<span id="L971" class="LineNr"> 971 </span><span class="htmlItalic">&lt;200b&gt;            </span>
<span id="L972" class="LineNr"> 972 </span>
<span id="L973" class="LineNr"> 973 </span><span class="htmlItalic">It was dawn and Dev was reading Rejog’s The Ghost Orchid when he heard the news: the old man had passed away peacefully during the night. Ana was inconsolable. Dev tried his best to see her in the two days leading to the funeral but to no avail. ‘I am sorry, Dev’, Tysa said seeing the hurt in the boy’s eyes: ‘Give her time. She was very fond of her grandfather.’ </span>
<span id="L974" class="LineNr"> 974 </span>
<span id="L975" class="LineNr"> 975 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The funeral was attended by over 20,000 people. Politicians, scientists, artists and writers paid their last respects </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">to</span><span class="Green"> a man The Miragian newspaper called ‘...the most influential voice in Mirage’s education system in the last three decades.’&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic">. Dev’s family too paid their respects. Ella had already forgotten the man who had, less than a week ago, confessed to being in love with her almost all his adult life. As far as Jara was concerned, he was doing what was expected of a Miragian statesman and its future President; he knew nothing of his parents’ history with Rejog. </span>
<span id="L976" class="LineNr"> 976 </span>
<span id="L977" class="LineNr"> 977 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ana was by her mother’s side as the funeral pyre began to slowly crumble from the furnace within its body. When it was dusk and the pyre had done its work, Ana finally turned to Dev and spoke to him. ‘Come home with me, Dev. I have something for you.’ Ana led Dev to Rejog’s room. On his bed was a box full of books. ‘He wanted you to have all of this as well’, Ana pointed and said. </span>
<span id="L978" class="LineNr"> 978 </span>
<span id="L979" class="LineNr"> 979 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I can’t, Ana. All of this is rightfully yours. </span>
<span id="L980" class="LineNr"> 980 </span>
<span id="L981" class="LineNr"> 981 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘My grandfather knew me better than you do, don’t forget that. He told me a few nights before he died that this box should reach you. In it, are his favourite books. They are all for you.’ Dev was astonished. He wasn’t prepared for this at all. </span>
<span id="L982" class="LineNr"> 982 </span>
<span id="L983" class="LineNr"> 983 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Alright, I’ll keep them carefully. If you ever change your mind, Ana – </span>
<span id="L984" class="LineNr"> 984 </span>
<span id="L985" class="LineNr"> 985 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘- I won’t, believe me. I have no use for them.’ She noticed that her tone had hurt him. ‘I am sorry, Dev. I was preparing myself for his death, but not well enough it looks like.’</span>
<span id="L986" class="LineNr"> 986 </span>
<span id="L987" class="LineNr"> 987 </span><span class="htmlItalic">What are you going to do? </span>
<span id="L988" class="LineNr"> 988 </span>
<span id="L989" class="LineNr"> 989 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘I want to go to the countryside for a few days - that is what I want to do. Come with me.’ </span>
<span id="L990" class="LineNr"> 990 </span>
<span id="L991" class="LineNr"> 991 </span><span class="htmlItalic">They spent a week at the country home. Ana was keen on hiking and most of their days were spent visiting the same places. Mirage Peak was crowded this time as the full moon was two days prior. The Circadian monk Gaudharma was nowhere to be seen much to Dev’s disappointment. Ana made no mention of him. They were serving dinner later that evening when Ana exclaimed, ‘I know what we can do. Stay right here, Dev! Give me a few minutes’, and ran outside, leaving her barely-served plate. ‘You keep eating!’, she shouted on her way out, ‘I’ll be right back.’ Ana was prone to moments of proclamations. She gave the impression that it was impulsiveness, but Dev had learnt over the years that it wasn’t really the case: she’d planned it all along, worked out the likelihood of her mad plans succeeding, and only then would she announce it to Dev when he least expected it. This was no different. What has she cooked up this time?</span>
<span id="L992" class="LineNr"> 992 </span>
<span id="L993" class="LineNr"> 993 </span><span class="htmlItalic">He finished dinner and cleared the plates waiting for her to return. Ana shouted from outside the hall, ‘Don’t come out yet! Stay right where you are.’  Dev walked around the dining room, examining the family photographs. There was Rejog and his wife, Ana’s parents as newly-weds and them as new parents, holding the infant Ana in their hands. There was one of Anaka from school, much older, closer to Dev’s first memory of her from the afternoon in the library all those years ago. Below it, a caption: ‘ANAKA-ODONATA ZIROMT, Outstanding Student, Form V’. Her face was more freckled then, auburn hair tied back in a pony-tail, unsmiling. </span>
<span id="L994" class="LineNr"> 994 </span>
<span id="L995" class="LineNr"> 995 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Okay, Dev!’ she had her hands in the air, ‘I have a surprise. Follow me.’ </span>
<span id="L996" class="LineNr"> 996 </span>
<span id="L997" class="LineNr"> 997 </span><span class="htmlItalic">What madness have you planned this time, Anaka-Odonata?</span>
<span id="L998" class="LineNr"> 998 </span>
<span id="L999" class="LineNr"> 999 </span><span class="htmlItalic">She stopped, turned around and laughed. ‘Now how did you come to know my middle name then, Master Mahasen?’ </span>
<span id="L1000" class="LineNr">1000 </span>
<span id="L1001" class="LineNr">1001 </span><span class="htmlItalic">School photograph. You are looking very friendly.</span>
<span id="L1002" class="LineNr">1002 </span>
<span id="L1003" class="LineNr">1003 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Ha! My teachers couldn’t get me to smile no matter what. The cameraman was the rudest idiot.’</span>
<span id="L1004" class="LineNr">1004 </span>
<span id="L1005" class="LineNr">1005 </span><span class="htmlItalic">She was leading him down the hall and to the front door. ‘Now’, she turned back to him again, ‘close your eyes. Come on.’ Dev did. She held him by his hands and led him outside. ‘Alright, open your eyes now.’ Anaka had laid cushions on the flat rock that stood in the centre of the garden. ‘I want to spend the night watching the stars with you.’  It was a clear night, not a cloud in the sky and the light of stars illuminated everything around them. Neither spoke for a long time. </span>
<span id="L1006" class="LineNr">1006 </span>
<span id="L1007" class="LineNr">1007 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Odonata is an interesting name. </span>
<span id="L1008" class="LineNr">1008 </span>
<span id="L1009" class="LineNr">1009 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev’s comical interjection into the complete silence of the night made Ana laugh. She pointed at the five-starred constellation and related the mythology it had inspired among Circadians, and how that in turn had inspired Rejog to suggest Odonata as Ana’s middle name. </span>
<span id="L1010" class="LineNr">1010 </span>
<span id="L1011" class="LineNr">1011 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I can’t believe you’ve never told me your middle name before - and it is a beautiful name, Anaka-Odonata. </span>
<span id="L1012" class="LineNr">1012 </span>
<span id="L1013" class="LineNr">1013 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Dev found himself lost in her again. Ten years had passed since he first met Anaka and her eccentric grandfather in an empty library. Ten years and it seemed everyday he found new reasons to go weak in her presence – and new ways of not being able to tell her the one truth. </span>
<span id="L1014" class="LineNr">1014 </span>
<span id="L1015" class="LineNr">1015 </span><span class="htmlItalic">He kissed her, starting with her forehead, then her eyes and finally her lips. Ana didn’t resist but pushed him gently back after their lips touched. ‘Why did it take you this long?’ There was resignation in her voice. Rejog’s last words to him echoed in Dev’s head then.</span>
<span id="L1016" class="LineNr">1016 </span>
<span id="L1017" class="LineNr">1017 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I wasn’t sure. </span>
<span id="L1018" class="LineNr">1018 </span>
<span id="L1019" class="LineNr">1019 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Sure of what exactly?’  </span>
<span id="L1020" class="LineNr">1020 </span>
<span id="L1021" class="LineNr">1021 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I wasn’t sure if you felt the same. </span>
<span id="L1022" class="LineNr">1022 </span>
<span id="L1023" class="LineNr">1023 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘How are you now sure I feel the same?’ There was whiplash in the question. </span>
<span id="L1024" class="LineNr">1024 </span>
<span id="L1025" class="LineNr">1025 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I am not, Ana. I am not. This moment felt right. </span>
<span id="L1026" class="LineNr">1026 </span>
<span id="L1027" class="LineNr">1027 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Right now?’ </span>
<span id="L1028" class="LineNr">1028 </span>
<span id="L1029" class="LineNr">1029 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Yes. </span>
<span id="L1030" class="LineNr">1030 </span>
<span id="L1031" class="LineNr">1031 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Felt right?’ </span>

<span id="L1033" class="LineNr">1033 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Yes. </span>
<span id="L1034" class="LineNr">1034 </span>
<span id="L1035" class="LineNr">1035 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ana drew in her breadth. ‘I’ve waited for you to tell me for so long, Dev. So fucking long. And it isn’t like you didn’t have the opportunity. We’ve spent days together! And yet you never said a word.’</span>
<span id="L1036" class="LineNr">1036 </span>
<span id="L1037" class="LineNr">1037 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ana, I am sorry I wasn’t – </span>
<span id="L1038" class="LineNr">1038 </span>
<span id="L1039" class="LineNr">1039 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘- I am not done yet. Don’t interrupt me’, she was struggling to ensure her voice was neutral. ‘You remember the first time we climbed Mirage Peak?’ </span>
<span id="L1040" class="LineNr">1040 </span>
<span id="L1041" class="LineNr">1041 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Yes. </span>
<span id="L1042" class="LineNr">1042 </span>
<span id="L1043" class="LineNr">1043 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘All it took was some hermit’s insane ramblings for you to completely forget me.’ </span>
<span id="L1044" class="LineNr">1044 </span>
<span id="L1045" class="LineNr">1045 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Ana it isn’t – </span>
<span id="L1046" class="LineNr">1046 </span>
<span id="L1047" class="LineNr">1047 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘ - Stop fucking interrupting! I realized on our way the mountain that day that the only people you could relate to are the hermits and people like my grandfather. And you are not going to change. I know this.’ </span>
<span id="L1048" class="LineNr">1048 </span>
<span id="L1049" class="LineNr">1049 </span><span class="htmlItalic">That is not true. </span>
<span id="L1050" class="LineNr">1050 </span>
<span id="L1051" class="LineNr">1051 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Really? Dev, are you joking when you say you want to live on the moon?’ </span>
<span id="L1052" class="LineNr">1052 </span>
<span id="L1053" class="LineNr">1053 </span><span class="htmlItalic">No, but that won’t happen. The chances of me – look, Ana only 30 men have ever walked the moon! – no one has lived there yet. It might happen in my lifetime, but me? It is just a foolish dream – </span>
<span id="L1054" class="LineNr">1054 </span>
<span id="L1055" class="LineNr">1055 </span><span class="htmlItalic">She sighed, ‘How naive are you, Dev? You want to know everything about everything but you don’t know yourself. You forget I saw your face when that hermit said that bullshit about the temple being the greatest library in the world.’ </span>
<span id="L1056" class="LineNr">1056 </span>
<span id="L1057" class="LineNr">1057 </span><span class="htmlItalic">I am sorry, Ana. </span>
<span id="L1058" class="LineNr">1058 </span>
<span id="L1059" class="LineNr">1059 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘Don’t apologize. Don’t you ever apologize for being who you are. Inside you there is a voice that constantly asks you to seek solitude. Inside of me there is a voice that is constantly asking me to see new things, meet new people.’ </span>
<span id="L1060" class="LineNr">1060 </span>
<span id="L1061" class="LineNr">1061 </span><span class="htmlItalic">What are you saying?</span>
<span id="L1062" class="LineNr">1062 </span>
<span id="L1063" class="LineNr">1063 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘I am leaving Mirage, Dev. You want to live on another world. I want to see all of this world, I want to travel to every corner of Pangaea.’ Dev hoped that the intensity of his beating heart and the quickness of his breathing was not noticeable. ‘Now that grandpa is dead, I have no reason to stay here.’ </span>
<span id="L1064" class="LineNr">1064 </span>
<span id="L1065" class="LineNr">1065 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Aren’t I a reason? </span>

<span id="L1069" class="LineNr">1069 </span><span class="htmlItalic">-I’ll be here. I’ll wait.  I only want to make you happy.</span>
<span id="L1070" class="LineNr">1070 </span>
<span id="L1071" class="LineNr">1071 </span><span class="htmlItalic">She ignored the interruption this time. ‘- But you aren’t a reason to stay. I am leaving for Circadia next week with my parents. Next week you become the youngest son of the youngest President in Miragian history. Next week my father will show my mother and I off to the diplomatic community in Circadia.’ Pause: ‘Next week our lives will change. But tonight, Dev Mahasen’, the smile returned again and Dev felt something deep inside of him leap up in joy at the sight of her smiling face – and that very thing then imploded. ‘Tonight, we have the stars, you and I.’ </span>
<span id="L1072" class="LineNr">1072 </span>
<span id="L1073" class="LineNr">1073 </span><span class="htmlItalic">We do. </span>

<span id="L1075" class="LineNr">1075 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Later that night Dev and Ana watched a spectacular meteor shower above them. When it was done, Ana, her head resting on Dev’s chest, turned to him, ‘I am sleepy. You?’ </span>
<span id="L1076" class="LineNr">1076 </span>
<span id="L1077" class="LineNr">1077 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Not yet, but it is getting colder. We should go in.</span>

Often, they spent it in complete silence; Dev because he was afraid opening his mouth would cause a torrent of words proclaiming his love for Ana while she feared anything she said now would irrevocably hurt him.  It was a strange week, but one they had enacted before when they met first as children. Even then his shyness had made it difficult for Ana to get through to him. The night before she was to leave, before Jara was to be sworn in as President, Ana and Dev walked the corridors of the library together for the last time. Everything smelled of Rejog. </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">Or</span><span class="Green"> did Rejog smell like old books?&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic"> Ana even remembered the game of hide-and-seek they had played in the giant library when they were children.

The dusty floor creaked as they fumbled taking each other’s clothes off - like it was laughing at their comic cluelessness with the mechanics of foreplay. The love-making was hurried, both bodies unfamiliar with rhythm or tempo, both minds unable to reconcile ideas with action. Dev was lost in the sweet odour of Anaka’s neck and breasts. You are a Goddess, he whispered into her ears as Anaka’s breathing became louder and embrace tighter, plunging him deeper into her so that Dev could lose himself in her like she knew he had wanted to ever since they passed the awkward first years of puberty. They fell asleep on the floor with nothing to protect them from the dust and insects except for their coital sweat and tears. </span>

This was what his father yearned for but was cruelly deprived of it by cowards. No matter. In the grand scheme of things, the writing of the first chapters of the Mahasen legend had only been postponed, not prevented, from being committed to the pages of history. Jara would write the opening chapters. Hasyl will take my place thereafter, I am sure of it. His eyes sought his family. He picked out Ella from the VIP section. Dressed in all white, Ella looked radiant – and it was all thanks to the endless reservoir of energy and selfless dedication that Ohiy possessed. He tried locking eyes with his mother’s but hers was vacant. Her eyes might be open, but her mind was already wandering, where Jara had no clue. Ohiy sat by her side. Could she, Jara wondered, have ever imagined that she would go from inmate to now attending a Presidential swearing-in ceremony? Ohiy’s eyes met his. They smiled at one another. Thank you everything Jara tried saying to her with his eyes. She understood – she always did – and nodded. It was Ohiy who had the glow of maternal pride, not Ella. Hasyl was by his grandmother’s side on her left. Dressed in military uniform, he looked much older than his 27. Above all, Hasyl looked ready to play his part. To Ohiy’s right was Manal. He was feigning interest, but Jara had to admit: Manal had, for once, followed his every command in dressing for the occasion. But wait. Where is Dev? Jara’s eyes scanned the row his family was sitting in. Where is Dev?! </span>

<span id="L1150" class="LineNr">1150 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The Trinity walked on stage. The ceremony was ready to begin. The Miragian flag was raised and its anthem sung. The air of optimism in the crowd was tangible: it seemed everyone belted the song out from the core of their beings. </span>
<span id="L1151" class="LineNr">1151 </span>
<span id="L1152" class="LineNr">1152 </span><span class="htmlItalic">Where is Dev? Jara craned his neck as the flag rose. The cloudless sky was all blue except for the crows, those damn crows.

Everyone sat down. </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">The</span><span class="Green"> Trinity – Prophet Saman CCCLIII, Prophet Shiva CCCXL and Prophet CCCXLV in this case – represented the religious apex of Miragian society. Each Prophet was chosen according to a three-thousand-year tradition: the identification of boys born of Immaculate Conception, their education in the ancient ways of their tribe </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> years before the standing Prophet of the tribe died. That would be the time would </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> one of these boys, the wisest of the lot, to assume the </span><span class="Aqua">role</span><span class="Green"> of Prophet </span><span class="Aqua">for</span><span class="Green"> their tribes.

<span id="L1154" class="LineNr">1154 </span><span class="htmlItalic">The Trinity stood and approached the podium. Together, they sang the words of invocation to Mother Mirage: ‘Water. Wind. Soil. Fire. You manifest in all that was, all that is, and all that ever will be. You who, in your infinite bounty, hath bequeathed us this land, to you we pay homage, children to Mother.’ The Trinity made the sign of Mother Mirage </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">arms</span><span class="Green"> bent, fingers together and hands pointing skywards, palms turned inwards&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic">: ‘In eternal servitude’, the Trinity said.

Our nation – every Samanian, Shivaputra and Adamite among you – has spoken: Jara Mahasen will lead us into the next decade. He takes on a solemn responsibility, for the Presidency of Mirage is not merely a political responsibility as it may be with our neighbours, but a cosmic one. Jara Mahasen will today be the fifteenth President of our blessed nation. Over these two centuries, the role of Miragian President has been bestowed by the people of Mirage to a select few who have understood Mirage’s place as unique in this tapestry of nations that we call Pangaea. Jara Mahasen’, the Prophet turned to face him. ‘Please approach us.’ The Trinity stood at the centre of the stage. The Trinity placed their right palms on top of one another’s, Prophet Saman’s being the top-most; on this they carefully laid the Book of Mirage </span><span class="Green">&lt;</span><span class="OrangeItalic">considered</span><span class="Green"> to be the foundational document of the Miragian nation&gt;</span><span class="htmlItalic">, they then bent their left hand, brought the fingers together and pointed towards them towards the sky, with palms facing inwards. ‘Place your right hand on this book and repeat after us, Jara Mahasen.’ Jara quickly scanned his surroundings again. Above him the crows still fluttered. He placed his right hand on the Book and his left hand bent, palms facing him. </span>

People had milled around him, eager to see the new President officially begin his duties. No one, evidently, had any idea that that new president’s youngest was amongst them at that very moment. ‘[Geo politics and domestic politics need to be alluded to. ]Right man for the job, that’s what I say. Almost voted for his father, but then those bastards murdered him.’ ‘Ay, time to bring some equality into this country – and tell outsiders to mind their own business.’ </span>
<span id="L1162" class="LineNr">1162 </span>
<span id="L1163" class="LineNr">1163 </span><span class="htmlItalic">More voices agreed with the first two. Someone clapped as the Trinity’s invocation of Mother Mirage was over. Dev felt a hand on his shoulder. ‘I hope we didn’t keep you waiting.’ </span>

<span id="L1186" class="LineNr">1186 </span><span class="htmlItalic">‘..and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United Tribes of Mirage.’ Jara immediately felt a great weight press against his head as the last words rolled out of his tongue.  This is happening. There is no turning back now. The crows were still above, but their numbers had dwindled. One perched atop the flagpole. Jara thought he heard clapping. He turned towards the crowd and indeed there was applause. People were standing and clapping. He waved and flashed the smile he had spent an entire month perfecting in front of the mirror. </span>
