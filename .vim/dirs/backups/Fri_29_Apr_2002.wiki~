== Untools: Tools for Better Thinking == 

1. This site [https://untools.co/|UnTools] has a bunch of free tools and explainers for how to use tools for better thinking. 
2. Categories for tools include Systems Thinking, Decision Making, Problem Solving and Communication
3. From a communications standpoint, I think both the [[https://untools.co/minto-pyramid|TheMintoPyramid] and [[https://untools.co/situation-behavior-impact|Situation_Behaviour_Impact]] both seems worthy of a shot
4. Under Systems Thinking, Concept Maps, Connection Circles, Iceberg Model, Balance Feedback Loop, and Reinforcing Feedback Loop are also things I want to give a shot to. 


Some of these have applications for my work in [[MI]] ([[Miragian_Studios_Inbox]])
