\indent{'\textit{Machan}, I am going to die a virgin.'}

I looked up from the math problem that had stumped me for the last two weeks. here

'We are all going to die virgins', Thilan continued. 'Did you notice none of them even looked or said hello to us?'

'Who, the girls?'

'Yeah! It's been almost a month since we got integrated. I mean they didn't even talk to Azaad. If he doesn't get a second look, what chance do the rest of us have? We are fucked.' He paused. 'Well that's not true. No girl is ever going to fuck me. No girl is ever going to fuck you. No girl is even going to fuck Azaad - and he's the pretty one!

'Okay, we have our mid-term test coming up, can we --?'

'Adey, \textit{mara} bugger you are! I am scared I am going to die a virgin. I am scared all my boys are also going to die virgins. And do you know why?'

'No why?'

'It's this fucking uniform', he pointed at the school crest on the left breast pocket of our light blue shirts. He was right; combined with dark blue trousers we did look slightly ridiculous even by the standards of Sri Lankan school uniforms. 'We look like security guards! All the girls must think we are security guards.'

'You realize they wear the same uniforms', I reminded him.

'Yeah but those skirts make a difference, it makes them look like women in the air force. All of them. Especially Shaila.'

The mention of the name made something within me jump - in excitement or fear, I couldn't tell.

Thilan saw the change in my face. 'Okay, okay, you went after her first, she's yours.'

'Mine? I don't think she even knows I exist.'

'Yes, but you are both Tamil. And from Jaffna also! The only Jaffna Tamil boy in our batch is you, the only Jaffna Tamil girl in our batch is her - it's a match made in heaven! Only a matter of time before she comes around, tells her parents, and before you know it you two will have kids and a family and ...'

'Thilan, \textit{machan} we turned 17 a couple of months back. Don't you think..'

'Is studying all you can think of, you bugger?'

'Oi. We barely passed the O-Levels - Sam made it clear that the two of us are on thin ice. Also...is falling in love, fucking, getting married and having kids all you can think of? This is real life, not some shitty Tamil film romance', I countered.

'How can you not? This is not new, I am not doing anything that's never been done before. Thousands of men over history have been sad and wondered if they'd win the love of their life or die miserable. You do poetry and literature - how do you not know this?'

'Thousands of men have also wondered if they'd solve the math problem in front of them.'

'You are useless. I am going to the basketball court. Want to come?'

'I wouldn't mind a game after school. Too risky now with Sam on his usual walk around the compound.'

'Oh for fuck's sake, bugger. I don't want to play. I just want to go away from here and hangout in the carpenters' shed and listen to the Walkman in peace, so I don't have this', he pointed at the open books in front of him, 'to look at.'

'You go. I'll see you after school. Sure you don't want to play some One Bump before we go home? You only need to bat - I need some catching prac..'

'You are the reason we are going to die virgins', he stood up.

'Be careful! Don't get caught to Sam. I can't be calling and explaining to your father again!', he was out before I could finish the sentence.

As long as I can remember I always enjoyed going to school.

This doesn't mean that I was a particularly good student - on the contrary, most teachers found me unfocused, lazy, distracted, often lacking any real academic ambition. It also doesn't mean I was a miscreant - I was one of the 'decent boys', incapable of any real mischief, unless under duress from some of my more anarchic classmates.

I just was - an existence, neither seen nor heard. And really, I didn't want it any other way.

But I looked forward to new academic years, every year, mostly because it was the only time I would go about shedding the coat of mediocre anonymity: sports season would have me fully engaged, and once in a way I'd win in track or do something in the cricket field that would briefly impress the teachers in charge of sports.

But this year the excitement within me was electric: I was now a senior. The thought of being in classrooms in the second floor of the school - reserved for seniors from Grade 9 to Grade 12 - had me giddy. Even the subjects sounded \textit{grown-up} in a way none of the subjects in Junior Section was. \textit{Maybe, interesting enough that I won't fall asleep in class?}.

And that is why I was convinced that day that this year, and the three years that would follow up to my A-Level exams at the end of Grade 12, were going to be the best years of school.

\textit{But this year is going to be different, bitch}, I lectured myself on the mirror. You are a grown-ass teenager now, that fuzzy mustache doesn't lie, surely? It could only mean that adulthood - and whatever that entatiled - was hurtling towards me at some breakneck speed, and I needed to change accordingly. 'No more \textit{Day Dreamer Thayalan}, bitch!', my voice rose audibly as I tried to motivate myself through verbal self-abuse.

'\textit{Dei}, who are you talking to?' my mother shouted from inside the kitchen.

'No one, \textit{amma}', I shouted back. 'Just err practicing this poem we have to recite.'

'That's a lie! What poems have the word \textit{bitch} in it?', my sister chimed in from her room.

\textit{Brat}, I muttered under my breadth. 'I'll write one with the word bitch in it, just to annoy you!', I shouted back from inside the bathroom but she paid no heed.

\textit{Good morning, good morning, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. The time is 6am and I am Tracy, your host for the next hour on NTL 101.8. We got some pretty great music lined up - if I do say so myself! - and we will chat about the mad things happening in the world over your breakfast and mine - just don't tell my boss, okay? I am not supposed to eat and do this. Hopefully, this will prove a great start to your day - otherwise, I would have woken up at this godforsaken hour for no reason, okay children? Please keep Tracy akki company. This is}, Counting Crows \textit{with Long December}.

\textit{My god}, Thilan thought to himself as he got dressed. \textit{Is it just me or does Tracy sound even more beautiful today?} This was the part of the day he looked forward to most: Tracy's voice early in the morning on NTL 101.8 FM. She always sounded like something out of heaven, but today \textit{today, she sounds like a Goddess.} Plus, she had played his favorite song. \textit{Who knows, today might actually be a good day?}

\textit{'Putha!'} his father called out. 'Come and eat.' Thilan winced.
