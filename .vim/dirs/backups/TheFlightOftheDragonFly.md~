The Miragian Moon Temple was built in the likeness of the Temple of Butterflies on Mirage Peak, but it differed in significant ways: the lunar counterpart was considerably larger, it possessed a meditation deck just below the spire, and it was a technological marvel. It was from here Dev contemplated the delicate Gaia, high above the horizon. It would be the new moon down there, but here on the moon, it was Full Gaia, a blue marble bathing in the rays of the sun. 

Dev remembered the first time he had seen Gaia rise through his own eyes. At that moment, before he realized it, his mind, drunk on nostalgia, stumbled down into the dusty corridors of memory. Dev excused himself from the gathering, retreated to his quarters and retrieved Rejog’s manuscript. He hadn’t read it since the night Rejog died; more than a decade had whizzed by. He turned to what he remembered was his favourite verse of The Ghost Orchid. A meditation on why poetry is necessary for the human soul, Rejog’s narrator suggests that writing poetry isn’t meant as an act of purging one’s unhappy memories, but rather to allow the unhappiness to become the soil in which the seeds of poetry would be sown; catharsis, like gardening, was only possible by getting your hands dirty.  He wondered then to himself: Is that what I have done, by coming and volunteering to live on the moon? Did I come here so that I can sow seeds of my misery into my poetry in complete solitude?  

Outside, the two week-long lunar night descended over the nearside of the moon.  The Sabine Crater enclosure was abandoned today. There’d be no rush of wealthy pilgrims from Mirage seeking spiritual cleansing at the lunar abode of Mother Mirage. Nothing stirred in his line of vision. 

Dev turned back and stepped into the corridor that led to the inner sanctum of the temple. He had minimal duties to attend to today so he chose to have an early meal. The kitchen was dark, but the lights came on as soon as he stepped in. 

<Hello, Dev>, a stoic voice greeted him from the tiny speaker behind the kitchen counter. <Do you need any assistance?>

Hello, OVI. Yes. I thought I would have an early meal and go to bed. 

<Would you like anything in particular, Dev?> 

Soup please, thank you. 

<Yes, Dev. Your meal will be ready in five minutes.>

Thank you, OVI. 

Dev took his usual seat at the counter and gestured for the embedded screen to wake up. 

<Library accessed. Do you want to load last opened book?> 

Yes. 

Barely a second passed before the system loaded the book he had purchased, opening it at the exact line Dev’s eyes had comprehended last. 


<Nomad: The Eternal Journey of the Dom People, BY ANAKA-ODONATA ZIROMT, Pg 3>  
　　　　INTRODUCTION 
　　　　
I am a traveller, not a writer. It is a strange admission, certainly unworthy first words of a book; stranger when you consider that these are the words of someone who was raised by a writer and a librarian. It is important, then, I tell you why I wrote this at all, and to do so I must tell you a story. 

My grandfather, the late Rejog C Rackel, dreamt of building a library all his life. It would be, he announced to my mother who was little over ten years old then, the largest in the world, one that would be devoted to the ruthless acquisition, comprehension and dissemination of all knowledge as it was being acquired, comprehended and disseminated by those who had acquired, comprehended and disseminated that knowledge on their various fields of study. He reasoned that by reconciling all knowledge – the totality of insights from our sciences, our humanities, our arts – would lead us to the fundamental truths of all life: nothing less than why it is we are here, how it is we got here, where it is we are headed, and how it is that we can wonder about all of these things at all. 

My grandfather hailed from a wealthy and influential family, yes, but it was his academic background that gained the attention of the politicians of his time. To them he proposed the idea of this grand library of all knowledge. They laughed until realization dawned that my grandfather wasn’t joking. 

Over the next two decades he expounded on the idea in his weekly column on The Miragian, at times going as far as to explicitly ask for support from his legion of devoted readers; among them was former President Jaruna Abey. The then Minister Abey paid a visit to my grandfather and on that evening a deal was struck: in exchange for my grandfather’s support for Minister Abey in the upcoming Presidential race he was promised a cabinet posting at the Ministry of Education, and, most importantly, a budget allocation for his pet project. 

What we know through the pages of history is that Abey won the elections and kept to his promise. My grandfather was given the approval to go ahead with the building of the library. As you may have gathered by now my grandfather was a man of obsessions – he poured himself into every aspect of the new library’s work. He chaired all meeting with architects and city planners. He spent nights awake pouring over proposals for the design of the library. It was during this period he realized his eyesight was failing him. In five years, at the age of 55, as The Miragian National Library neared completion, he would be almost completely blind. He hadn’t learnt Braille and never read another word again.  

It isn’t my intention to dispute the pages of history. Nor am I insinuating that credit for the building of the library wasn’t give to the man who originally dreamt of it and pursued it until he was completely blind; my grandfather realized before anyone that only a politician’s interest could help this mad (some derided the project as being too idealistic) dream come to fruition, and he was happy for any politician to get the plaudits – and the votes – as long as he got his dear library built. 

With that achieved, my grandfather resigned from his post in the Ministry and became the first director of The Miragian National Library. Years went by but he continued going to the library every day until the last months of his life. I accompanied him to the library every afternoon after school. My task was simple: I was to be his reader. He suggested books that I ought to read just so he could hear the music of the words that had enraptured him as a child. This went on for over 10 years – on hindsight, a better education I couldn’t have asked for – and one afternoon as I read to him the travel diaries of Isa Fonceka, the famed [delete]travel writer and anthropologist, he sighed aloud. He was glum. ‘Ana’, his voice morose: ‘I haven’t seen enough of the world. I was foolish then and blind now, but learn from me, little one. I hope you will see more of the world than I ever did.’ 

Those words haunt me every day like the ghostly melody of a favourite song stuck in the head. And like the lyrics of any timeless song, his words have evolved in their meaning to me as I have grown older. I now see his urge for me to see the world through my own eyes as a plea to walk away from the vicarious nature of our acquisition of knowledge. This is truer now than ever before in human history. We no longer have to devote entire buildings for the acquisition, comprehension and dissemination of knowledge. We send robots to the harshest landscapes in our world to acquire knowledge on our behalves. In our pockets are handheld devices that allow us to acquire possibly all of human knowledge just by asking our OVIs the right questions. But here is a question your OVI device might not be able to answer: is knowledge gained in increasingly vicarious ways knowledge at all, or is it merely trivia? I don’t pretend to have the answer. 

This book is about a people who don’t subscribe to acquiring knowledge vicariously; indeed, they actively display disdain towards the written tradition: theirs is an oral culture. The Dom people don’t claim a special understanding of the universe, they have no Gods, they have no prophets, no central political leadership, and they don’t even have a homeland. Yet I knew within a week of meeting them for the first time that my fate and theirs would be intertwined when an elderly matriarch of the tribe told me, ‘We don’t have libraries and wise men, but our memories are good and our memories are our own.’ Six nights later, under the April full moon, I abandoned my studies, packed a small bag, and began a nomadic life with the Dom people. 

This book, based on my daily diary entries over the four years I spent crossing Pangaea with the Dom people, is my attempt to tell their story; for now, more than ever in their history of ceaseless persecution by supposedly civilized nations and peoples, their story needs to be heard. 
						
　　　　 I
The Thar Desert is a harsh place to witness the beginning of anything. The desert, over four times as large as the land area of Mirage, is at first sight a desolate, sandy wasteland cloaked from the eyes of human civilization for eons by a salt marsh towards its southern borders, the mighty Indói River, which runs parallel to The Thar’s western edge, and the Arvalli Range in the east. But it is here the story of Mirage began and, perhaps aptly, it is here the story of my journey with the Dom people began.  
Towards the end of my graduate studies I had an opportunity to be part of an anthropological survey into the world’s nomadic people. I have always been fascinated by the Dom population and, as chance would have it, they were the first of our sample groups. The research team, led by Professor A M Novakhazi, left to Sikar, a hamlet that sits at The Thar’s north-eastern boundary. It is the final outpost of human civilization inside Circardia’s borders. The Dom people, numbering in their tens of thousands, gather here for their biennium mass pilgrimage; what they colloquially refer to as ‘a walk in the garden’. This ‘walk in the garden’ will see them re-enact the most revered journey of their ancestors who braved The Thar to reach the river banks of the Indói, from which they ventured into The Raan of Kachchh and emerged out to the town of Nadiad in the South; from Nadiad they’d continue walking, nestled by the Ghats parallel to the Western most borders of Circadia, for a further 1200 miles until they reach the shores of Lake Circadia. This is the end of the pilgrimage. The massive murmaration of people then dissipate back their separate ways, but never to a homeland for they have none (that phrase ‘their separate ways’, which we use so casually, is completely redefined by the Dom people). No Dom dares cross the waters of Lake Circadia and reach the opposite shore that is ten miles away, but Dom folklore tells of the only instance in this five thousand year tradition of ‘the walk in the garden’ when a large group of Dom decided to cross the lake and see what lay beyond the palm trees on the opposite shores. They never came back. 
The Dom, unlike the early Miragians, didn’t write down their history. What we have on their origins is passed down for eons through oral story-telling. In this dearth of reliable texts, we are left with two approaches to identifying the relationship between the Dom people and Miragians over millennia: a linguistic route and a genetic route. 
The first requires only you understanding the Miragian tongue. The story I related above wasn’t told to me; rather it was the elderly matriarch relating it to Professor Novakhazi in the Domian language. To my surprise, I found I understood (I devote an entire section to the similarities between the Miragian and Domian languages so I will not spend too much time on the topic here) and even words that were foreign I could guess their meaning in context, and more often than not found that I was correct. 
A more empirical approach was explored by a group of geneticists, and their findings published in the Miragian Journal of Genetics. This seminal paper confirmed what most anthropologists and linguists had long suspected: Miragians and the Dom share a common ancestry. The evidence is, quite literally, in our blood. Further corroboration came when archaeological evidence of primitive tools found on the Miragian shores of Lake Circadia suggested that the first Miragians settled on its shores around 3,500 years ago, around the time, Dom folklore tells us, the group splintered into two.
So, what caused the one instance of the splintering? What possessed a possibly sizeable group within a very nomadic people to look at the Miragian shores about ten miles across a vast lake and convince themselves that it could be a home for eternity?
Since science has not given us answers yet, I will defer to an extraordinarily passionate response from the elderly matriarch when I asked her this question. ‘You Miragian?’ She asked me, cutting me off midpoint. I nodded. ‘I see fear of death. It is in your eyes. Like all Miragians. Like first Miragians. They left us, crossed the water because they afraid land eventually kill us all. They feared future. Dom doesn’t fear future. For the Dom, only the now. There was a now. There is a now. There will be a now. When we look back at yesterdays’ nows, we look back because we want to tell our children and our grandchildren stories of our many nows that touched us. To look forward to the nows of tomorrow is foolish – there are no stories in the future until the future becomes a now.’ she paused and with a mischievous glint added:  ‘To look forward is Miragian.’ 
						

						II

The week spent in Sikar passed quickly. During the day we interviewed as many of the Dom as we could, but their numbers swelled far quicker than our research team could cope with; Professor Novakhazi estimated around 45,000 had gathered in three days. 
The Dom move in small tribes of roughly one hundred members, each named after a Matriarch from the past. For instance, the matriarch who we befriended was from the Štar clan, and she herself was called Štar after the Great Mother who, according to folklore, was the virgin mother of septuplets, four sons and three daughters, whose inter-breeding gave birth to the clan five hundred years ago. 
As the moon grew larger with every passing night, I found it harder to come to terms with leaving them and going back to the comforts of my life in Circadia, back to study halls and insufferable social obligations that I had as the daughter of a diplomat. On Full Moon’s eve, the Dom, by now numbering an estimated one hundred thousand, had gathered. After the full moon was sighted, the Dom would celebrate.  Štar invited us to join them. We went around 9 and the celebrations were in full swing. 
Štar’s caravan was cloaked behind great plumes of smoke. I heard her loud laughter come from inside. I entered, not realizing Professor Novakhazi and my companions were mixing with the other members of the Štar clan. ‘Ahh, Miragian girl. You came’, I looked around. There was no one else in the caravan. Štar was laughing all by herself. 
‘Yes, Štar. I came. Thank you for having us.’ 
‘Sit’, she beckoned me closer. ‘Pretty eyes, girl. What they call you?’ 
‘Anaka’ 
‘The All-Seeing one. Old Miragian name.’
‘Yes’
‘Are you All-Seeing, girl?’ 
I couldn’t help but laugh. ‘No. Sometimes I can’t see what’s in front of me.’ 
‘Do you know how I became Matriarch of clan?’ 
‘No, you never told us.’ 
‘Matriarch of a Dom clan is one who walk away from tragedy with rare gift. The first Štar thrown out by father, she was with child. She starve, no shelter from harsh sunny days, and cold nights, but she survive, and for her trouble she was given a gift: not with one, but seven children fathered by some unknown spirit. Me, I watched them burn my caravan down, my family inside. I spent days wishing that they had killed me too, but no. 
‘Who burnt down the caravan?’
‘They.’
I decided to not press her on the point. There was a long period of silence. I thought I could see the faint glimmer of a tear rolling out of her eyes. 
‘My fate different, girl’, She said, breaking the silence. ‘My fate different. I became eye-reader. That is why I am the Matriarch of this clan. I see fears, hopes, lies, memories that hide in the eyes of man, woman and child, Dom, Miragian or Circadian.’ She paused again and looked me in the eye. ‘I read yours.’ 
‘You said I had the fear of death in my eyes, like all Miragians.’ 
‘You understand when I say ‘fear’? 
‘No’ 
‘Yes, you do. Lies.’ 
I hesitated. ‘Yes, I do’ 
‘Tell.’
The music outside was getting louder and more rambunctious. Inside the caravan, the smoke got thicker. ‘I am afraid I won’t have enough time to see all of Gaia.’ 
Štar had the beatific smile we associate with hermits – and yet she was anything but. ‘Inside you, girl, is fight between blood; between Dom and Miragian. You fear Miragian win.’ 
The thought had run through my mind, but I had dismissed it. ‘You’re wrong’, I protested. 
‘Lies.’
I didn’t respond. 
‘Something else I see in your eyes.’
‘Tell me’, my voice was brittle. 
‘The dragonfly inside’, she whispered into my ears. ‘Let her fly, girl.’
　　　　
　　　　III
Later that night, I sat at the table by my bed at the Sikar lodge and wrote the following note to my parents: 
	Dear Mama and Papa, 
This is a difficult note to write but I urge you to read it in the full knowledge that I’ve taken this decision for the sake of my happiness. I’ve decided to join a nomadic clan in their annual pilgrimage. At dawn we will set off from Sikar and head towards Lake Circadia. I’ve been told that the journey will last six full moons. Please understand that I need this. There is so much to learn from them, so much for them to show me. I need this more than all the hours I will spend in study halls studying about these very people.
You can expect to see me towards the end of the year, safe and sound.
	I will miss you. 
	All my love, 
	Yours,
	Ana 
I knocked on Professor Novakhazi’s door when the sound of the crows could be heard outside my window. He opened the door, bleary-eyed. 
‘I am sorry to wake you up so early, Professor Novakhazi.’
‘That’s alright. What’s the matter, Ziromt?’ 
‘I am leaving with the Štars’, I handed him the note I had written for my parents. ‘I am going on the walk in the garden, Professor.’ 
He sighed, but showed very little surprise. ‘You think this note will somehow placate your parents?’ 
‘No’
‘Your father will be apoplectic.’ 
‘Yes’ 
‘I am responsible for you lot, you know?’ 
‘Yes. But you also know that I have thought this through and that I will be safe under Štar’s care. If you didn’t, you would be angry right now.’ He shook his head. 
‘You are difficult, Ziromt, irritating too, but I will miss you in my lecture halls.’
‘I’ll be back’, I hugged him. ‘And don’t worry about my parents. They know my stubborn streak well enough to know that you had no chance to change my mind.’ 
‘Goodbye, Ana. Old Rejog, he’d be proud.’ 
I waved and turned towards the stairs. 
The town was about a kilometre away from the Dom settlements. I ran towards it as the sound of conch shells grew louder. Each clan had a shell that was passed down from generation to generation, some conchs as old as 300 years old, each singing a tune that specifically called for its clan members to gather as one. I listened for the Štar theme. It is a brief melody, using a mere three notes, but its’ distinctive airiness had already engrained itself in my mind. Running through crowded grounds filled with children playing games, past recent campfires, overtaking caravans, I finally made it to the Štars. They had gathered around Štar when I interrupted, out of breadth and hunched on my knees. 
I felt countless eyes on me. 
Štar laughed. One by one her clan joined her and very soon so did I, still breathing heavily from the running. 
‘You come, girl. Again.’
‘Yes’, I managed to say. ‘I want to walk in the garden with you.’
The laughter subsided. A little girl seated on Štar’s lap got off and walked towards me. She offered her hand. I took it and crouched so her eyes and mine met. 
‘Me Di’, the little girl said. ‘What do call, sister?’ 
‘She’, Štar interjected from behind with smoke blowing out her mouth, ‘Dragonfly.’

His couldn’t feel his feet, but something was underneath his bed sheet. He could smell it. Where is the light? The light?! The fucking light? His hands stumbled and found the switch for the night lamp. He turned it on. The bed sheet rippled. Snakes? Fuck. Shit. He pulled the sheets back while bracing his shoulders, arms and torso so that he could yank himself out of the bed with force. But his legs wouldn’t move while his eyes surveyed the nightmare underneath his sheets. Countless maggots, aroused by the aroma of man flesh, were congregating on his heavily wounded left leg.  Rotting flesh clung to broken bone. Screaming, unable to still move the lower half of his body, he tried using his hands to push away the worms. 
‘Major Mahasen, wake up. Major Mahasen. Wake up.’ 
Opening his panic-stricken eyes, Hasyl was confronted by the look of concern on the man’s face. 
‘Are you alright, Major Mahasen? You were having a bad dream I think.’ 
‘Where am I?’
‘You are in a military hospital, Major Mahasen. You are safe.’ 
‘How did I get here?’ 
‘You don’t remember much of yesterday?’ 
‘I remember getting out of the car. Everything else is a blank.’
‘That’s normal. Your memories will come back soon.’
‘Wait...I remember you, Doctor.’ 
‘There…you see, you are starting to remember already.’ 
‘I apologize for my behaviour last night, Doctor...Doctor?’
‘Dr. Tarun Abey.’
‘Dr. Abey I am truly sorry about –‘
‘- that’s quite alright, Major Mahasen. You were suffering from trauma. It’s natural to be emotional, even angry.’ 
‘You saved my life. Thank you.’ 
‘Don’t mention it. Now about those nightmares?’ 
‘I’ve had nightmares before, but nothing out of the ordinary. Not like this.’ 
 ‘It is possibly because of what you went through. And you are on painkillers. I wouldn’t worry. You’ll get better soon’, he was reading real-time vitals on his OVI device. ‘Judging by this, I’d say you are in a stable condition. I will check on you in the evening. Get plenty of rest. Good day.’ He turned to leave. 
‘Dr Abey?’
‘Yes, Major’
‘I still feel an itch there, where my left leg was. Is that normal?’
‘The itch or twitching you feel around the stump are the nerve-endings - these communicate your sense of touch. Right now, that particular area of the leg’s nerve-endings are reorganizing themselves post-amputation, Major. It is uncomfortable, I understand, but it is normal.  Give it time. You’ll be fine.’ 
‘Thank you, Doctor.’ 
‘Pleasure. Now remember: Get some rest. I’ll pass news of your recovery. Your father will be a relieved man.’ 
　　　　 
Ohiy woke to the familiar jangle of the bell. Ella was awake. Ohiy sighed. Her friend had become difficult, even childlike, in her behaviour during the last few years. Was it the fate of the terminally-ill-and-bed-ridden to relieve their infant years as they approach death and their memories evaporate, she wondered. Will it be my fate? And if so, who will humour my descent into this last infantilism? She put the thought aside. There was work to be done. She braced herself against the walking stick and called on all her strength to stand up. 
Jara had insisted Ohiy move to his room after he moved to Ironwood Trees <the official residency of The President of Mirage> so that she didn’t have to walk from the other end of the house to attend to Ella. Now that their rooms were on opposite sides of the corridor, Ella seemed to call Ohiy more frequently, insisting that the attending nurse had wronged her. Ohiy realized over the years that it was Ella’s way of gaining attention. Most of the nurses never stayed long though; the apparent bragging rights among the nurse [nurse community ]community of being the caretaker of the president’s mother giving away to the pragmatic reality of a moody old woman who crowed and complained about everything, including, in some cases, their appearances. But the current nurse, Floa, had persevered by not taking Ella’s ranting personally. 
She opened the door and was immediately puzzled. 
‘Am I to die alone?’ there was indignation in Ella’s voice. 
‘Where is Floa?’
‘Am I to die –‘
‘- the nurse, Ella. Where is the nurse?’
‘ – I don’t know. Am I to die alone?’ 
‘Don’t be silly, Ella. You’ll drag me to the afterlife with that silly bell of yours’, Ohiy waved her hand dismissing the question. She walked towards the screen and touched the button. 
A male voice from the other end: ‘Kitchen here.’
‘Is Floa down there?’ 
‘Haven’t seen her, Miss Ohiy. Do you need anything?’
‘Send the orderlies in first. I need help giving madam a bath. And ask Floa to come see me if you meet her.’ 
‘Will do, Miss Ohiy.’ 
The orderlies came a few minutes later and helped Ohiy in bathing and getting Ella ready. After getting her dressed, Ohiy sat by Ella’s side and took both their medicine boxes out. She counted Ella’s pills and then her own. ‘Here’, she handed, ‘a few decades ago I was dealing you cards. Us in that tiny cell. You a frail little child locked in prison with angry old me. Do you remember?’ Ella remained silent. ‘Now all I have is pills, El.’ She paid Ohiy no attention. ‘Listen, woman. I too have to take my medicine. And I am older than you, and therefore more likely to die if I don’t.’ 
Ella relented. She poked out her hand. Ohiy handed her the medicine one by one, patiently waiting for Ella to gulp each pill down. ‘Good girl’, she patted Ella after it was done. ‘Now my turn.’ 
<INCOMING CALL>, an electronic voice interrupted, startling Ohiy. <Mahasen, Hasyl. Accept call?>
‘Yes, yes’, Ohiy replied. She hated that artificial voice. 
‘Good morning, Miss Ohiy. How are we today?’ Hasyl sounded happy.  
‘Good morning, Hasyl. Your grandmother is annoyed, but that is not unusual.’
‘Great, great. I’ll be there in half an hour’, he paused. ‘I am looking forward to today. It’s been a while.’ 
‘Your father is a busy man, Hasyl. You know that very well.’
‘Still. It’s been awhile since we sat down as a family and shared a meal. I miss that.’ Ohiy smiled to herself: the boy had changed so much - and for the better - in the last few years. ‘I also have news. I have an announcement to make, Miss Ohiy.’ 
‘Oh? What’s that?’ 
‘It’s a surprise. Be patient. I’ll be there soon’, he ended the call. 
						
‘These men, your brothers in arms, were shot. In cold blood’, the fat man paused. He was sweating. ‘Like animals. We can’t let that pass!’
‘No!’ Someone in the crowd shouted. 
‘We can’t pretend this didn’t happen!’ the politician’s voice grew louder. 
‘No’, more voices in the crowd. 
‘They ask. And they ask. Forever, they ask for more. And today they kill our brothers and ask us What are you going to do about it? They took the lives of men. Men just like you. Husbands. Fathers. Brothers. Soldiers. Samnian men. Patriots. By Mother Mirage, they were patriots!’ 
The crowd roared. 	
‘And for them, in their memory, we will answer the question these traitors asked us today. Today we give them our answer. This is what we will do to those who ask to divide Mother’s bounty. This is what we will do to traitors and terrorists. This is what we will do to those who harm our brothers!’ 
The collective roar for bloodlust shook Hasyl. He strode towards the stage. ‘Minister’, he whispered into the fat man’s ears. ‘May I have a word? In private, sir. Please’, Hasyl’s voice was insistent. 
The minister signalled his entourage to disperse. The crowd was still roaring. 
‘Well?’
‘That was unnecessarily provocative, Minister.’
‘Are you trying to tell me –‘
‘I don’t mean to tell you how to your job, sir but you are making my job harder. You’ve just provoked my unit to avenge the death of their comrades in a town where their only job is to keep things quiet and calm.’
‘Pfft. They’ll have a few drinks, go into town and slap a few of those savages around. Nothing to worry about.’ 
‘Either you are an idiot – or a cold-blooded monster. I don’t know - which one is it?’
‘I’d be very careful with the words I use if I were you, Major. Just because your fa -’
‘ - Oh I choose my words very carefully, Minister. If there is bloodshed tonight, we will lose the support of the entire Shivaputra population in Mirage. If there is bloodshed tonight you would have achieved in ten minutes what the separatists have been desperately trying to do for the past decade - you give their cause credibility. If there is bloodshed tonight, I will hold you personally responsible. If there is bloodshed tonight, I will see that you rot.’
‘So’, the minister gave a toothy smile, ‘this is why daddy doesn’t want you in politics.’ He walked away before Hasyl could retort. The crowd was dispersing but Hasyl knew where the soldiers were headed. 
A gun shot. A screamed threat. Another roar. 
Hasyl ran in the direction of the frenzied mob. Outside the camp, it was no longer just his men. In their midst were a group of the politician’s henchmen. The mob was making its way down the road to the Naffaj Public Library. Hasyl pursued the crowd in his jeep, but found himself unable to take the vehicle beyond a certain point. He shouted for them to halt, but was drowned out in the cacophony of hate. He fired his weapon in the air, but that did little to get the crowd’s attention. They continued marching, shouting slogans. Death to the traitorous animals! Death to them all! 
Hasyl got out of the jeep and dived into the crowd, forcing his way to the head of the mob. ‘Stop right now’, Hasyl shouted to the soldiers streaming past him. ‘That is a direct order!’ None paid attention. The continued marching past him, some even jostling him aside. Hasyl continued pushing forward until he could see the library’s facçade dominating the horizon. 
The mob stopped. In front of the gates of the library was another group, smaller and civilian. 
‘Samanian men have died today’, the man at the head of the mob announced towards the group guarding the gate, ‘many Shivas will pay!’ he barked. 
An old man stepped forward. ‘Please’, the old man put his hands up and walked towards the mob in slow measured steps. ‘Please’, he repeated. ‘There is no need for this. Let’s sit and discuss this like rational men.’
Hasyl, pushing his way through the crowd, could hear the bark clearly, ‘Three of ours died tonight because of your scum youth!’ 
‘And we will see they are tried for their crimes. We have them in captivity. Together we will ensure that they face the full wrath of the law for their crimes, but, brothers please, there is no need for mob justice.’ 
‘Who are you supposed to be?’ another voice snapped.
‘I am the caretaker of this library, but I speak for all of us Shivaputras in this town right now. Let us remember we are all countrymen –‘
The first voice laughed and the rest of the mob joined. ‘Fine joke’, the voice barked. ‘One moment you fuckers want a separate country but the moment you are about to get canned you are suddenly a bloody patriot.’ 
‘But I don’t want a separate country, brother’, the old man protested. 
Hasyl found himself increasingly unable to push through the thronging crowd. 
‘What do you want then?’ 
‘I want to see all Miragian faiths to have equally footing, brother. But above all I want to make sure there is no bloodshed – tonight or any night.’ 
‘You said you have the men who killed our brothers. Where are they?’ 
‘They are in our custody’, the old man replied. 
‘Give them to us’, the voice demanded. 
‘Brother, please. You are angry. Taking custody of the men suspected of killing is not your responsibility. It is that of the law.’ 
‘Listen, I am not interested in a civics lesson, old man. Give us the men and there won’t be any more problems from us. Refuse and we will find them in any way we can.’ 
Hasyl finally emerged from the throng: ‘What do you think you are doing?’ 
A bald man eyed Hasyl. ‘Who let him here?’ he snapped at the men standing behind him.  It was his voice Hasyl had heard threatening the civilians. Hasyl walked up to the man. ‘You are one of the minister’s dogs, aren’t you?’ 
‘I bite if you come too close.’
Hasyl stepped even closer, ‘Call off your men.’
‘My men are just a handful. The rest are yours. You call them off.’ 
Hasyl stepped away from the man and faced his soldiers. ‘You are soldiers of the United Tribes of Mirage. And I am your commanding officer. I order you to return to camp immediately. Failure to do so, and I will see every one of you court-martialled. Do I make myself clear?’ 
Their eyes still burnt. Not one soldier moved. 
‘What does it feel like to lose command, Major?’ the bald man teased. ‘That must make you useless – even to other faggots.’ Hasyl’s attempt at a punch merely grazed the bald man’s chin. His riposte, a vicious elbow, sent Hasyl to the ground. 
‘Touch me again’, the bald man climbed on Hasyl’s fallen body, yanked his collar and shook Hasyl like a rag doll. ‘Touch me again and I will rearrange your face. I don’t give a shit who your daddy is. Do we understand one another?’ his face loomed over Hasyl’s. Blood gushing down his shattered nose and into his mouth, Hasyl nodded. The bald man patted his cheeks. ‘That’s a good prince. Now don’t move. Don’t say a fucking word. Men at work, you see.’ 
He stood and motioned for the old man to come forward. ‘As you can see, I am running out of patience. I will ask once more: Where are those men?’  
The old man’s voice shook as he gathered himself. ‘Brother, you aren’t an officer of the –‘ 
His body dropped; the old man’s face shattered from the gunshot. The bald one walked closer and emptied his gun on the old man’s lifeless body. ‘Here lies a traitorous scum, brothers’, his voice was lowered, ‘Let’s find some more!’ and roared again. 
The group that had been guarding the gate scattered as the mob gave them chase. A young boy who tried escaping several times was pinned down while the mob pounded his kneecaps. A woman was stripped of her clothes, her hands tied to the metal bars of the library’s gate while some of the mob took turns to rape her.  Others dispersed in several directions. In the distance he could hear gunfire and see smoke billowing. Hasyl didn’t know how much time passed before the rest of the mob returned. He continued lying on the ground, his head in a puddle of mud, unsure if it was his impotence or the bald man that frightened him. 
They returned having evidently apprehended the men suspected of killing the soldiers. A chant Burn them! Burn the traitors! Burn the murderers!  was working its way to crescendo. When it did, as if on cue, some of the mob came bearing rubber tyres. The three suspects were beaten and adorned in necklaces of tyres while they pleaded for mercy. The bald man stepped forward, poured kerosene over the men and lit the fires. Hasyl thought he saw the bald man sporting a faint smile as the three men burnt and tormented screams pierced from their infernos. 
The mob then entered the library. Hasyl heard the breaking of glass, the toppling of book shelves. He saw the busts of writers bursting out of windows as the mob sought to destroy every vestige of the library’s spirit. Their work done, they filed out of the building and sat down and admired their work as the library burnt all night.   
　　　　                                       
<Our objective in publishing this special report with a focus on the events of 23rd July 2623 is to highlight the efforts of this government at enforcing social amnesia. That: i) the acts of genocide are a two-pronged strategy, one manifested in exercising brute force against a section of the population, the other in the form of a gradual defacing, and eventual destruction, of the other side’s cultural pillars. Seen against this light the burning of the library wasn’t - as one of the government’s more hawkish ministers dismissively claimed - ‘a few louts getting drunk and getting carried away’, but instead a systemic tactic employed by governments facing secession claims to erase the secessionists’ sense of identity, its sense of self – in effect, sowing the seeds of social amnesia among the secessionists by destroying those pillars they give rise to group consciousness in the first place; and ii) the climate of repression and censorship that looms over Mirage’s Forth Estate can no longer be dismissed as necessary in the interest of national security. The only reason a society refuses the tireless pursuit of political and historical truth is, we can only assume, for the same reason a man whose face is horribly scarred refuses to look at himself in the mirror. 
In monitoring the daily news sources following the burning of the library, we were depressed, but not surprised, when the event went unreported for a whole week. Then on the 31st of July, under an unremarkable headline, The Miragian claimed the library had reported a small fire that was soon put out. It also claimed negligence as the cause. 
It is startlingly clear the aims of the government in this regard: it isn’t merely to make us forget such events, but to forget what it is we forgot at all.    
EXCERPT FROM THE SPECIAL REPORT no.8 (7th March 2624), The Burning of the Naffaj Public Library: Biblioclasm and the Politics of Social Amnesia, BY The Naffaj Teachers for Human Rights (NTHR), Pg 83>
　　　　
Jara closed the report and rubbed his eyes. This aversion to sleep had to stop. But how? He contemplated seeking medical advice, but then a new fear appeared: what if my enemies get to know? What if there was a loud-mouthed idiot in my office who, in pillow talk with his wife or mistress, were to blurt it all out? There would be no stopping the rumour mill. It will reach the rats and they will use it to dispose of me from office. I can see the headlines now. No. I will have enough problems once this NTHR report goes public. What then? He wondered. Perhaps seek out Ohiy for advice when the family dropped in for breakfast later that day. He made a mental note as he opened the door to his study. In the corridor, the security detail was asleep, but instinct kicked in as soon as they were bathed in the light from Jara’s study. There was a brief look of terror in their faces. Jara motioned for them to relax. 
‘Your Excellency, is everything alright?’
‘Fine, fine’, Jara assured them. ‘I am hungry.’
They reached for their radios, ‘We’ll notify the kitchen staff to prepare you a meal.’
Jara cut them off. ‘I feel like making myself something. Don’t wake anyone up’, he continued walking past them. The Presidential Security Division were scattered all over the house, but particularly near windows and doors. As he made his way down the staircase, past the portraits of past presidents, to the east wing where the kitchen was located, he had to explain what he was doing. Jara resorted to having a finger over his lips and mouthing ‘shush’ at every encounter with a PSD agent. He realized he might look silly, but was too peckish to bother correcting himself. Finally reaching the entrance to the kitchen, he could hear voices from inside. 
‘...she sucked me off good, brother. Let me tell ye, Circadian women love my co… ’
Jara opened the door and saw two confused men. One had been munching away at a sandwich, his mouth now full. The other, evidently the teller of the sordid anecdote, was holding a bottle of beer. He waved them off before they could blabber apologies to him. ‘What is that?’ he asked pointing at the first one’s plate. He was frantically digesting the food in his mouth and unable to still talk. Jara turned his attention to the other agent. 
‘Erm...I think it is a beef sandwich’, he looked at his companion for confirmation – the sandwich-eater nodded, ‘Yes, it is a beef sandwich, Your Excellency.’
‘May I eat it? ‘, Jara looked in the direction of the sandwich eater. Gulping his food down, frantically nodding, he managed to say, ’Yes, yes, Your Excellency.’
Jara took the plate with the uneaten half of the sandwich. He looked at the beer drinker. ’You have more of those?’ The agent opened the refrigerator door and grabbed a bottle of beer.  ’I’ll have three.’ The agent handed Jara three bottles. 
Jara opened the first bottle. ’Continue with your story. I believe, you were at the part about Circadian women and their love for your cock. Cheers’, he toasted and turned back as the embarrassed agent raised his bottle in turn. 
He was drunk an hour later as the sun rose over the eastern sky. He had finished reading the NTHR report in the interim and even though he knew its contents would blight the rest of his political career, he chose instead to reflect, as drunken men do, on the meaning of the sunrise over the landscape of his being on a day when life turns, for better or for worse: does the sunrise on such days herald the promise of the impending fortune or doom? All he saw was the same orange hue meeting the faint blue of sky. No message was written in the heavens. He lumbered back to his table. How I wish I could sleep right now. He sat on his seat and threw away the report which knocked a picture frame off his table. It landed softly on the carpet. He crawled towards it. The frame laid face first on the carpet. He turned it around knowing which photo it held in place. Was this why Manal was so drawn to photography, he wondered, because it froze moments so perfectly, making them impervious to the ravages of emotion and change?  
What happened to that boy? He still remembered the year of the photograph as the time Manal walked in and coolly put forward his case. ’And why this sudden urge to study, much less study in Circadia?’, Jara had asked him when it was done. ’Because they are the centre of a global cultural revolution, father. Science, technology, art – those Circadians are changing the very way we live. I want to learn from them and then come back here to help you take Mirage closer to your vision’, Manal had delivered his rehearsed lie to perfection. 
Jara thought long before he decided to allow Manal to study in Circadia. ’One day’, Jara began as father and son said their goodbyes to one another at the airport, ’When I am no longer president, I hope my sons will each lead. That includes you too, Manal.’
’I know, father’, Manal replied. 
’You will come back… ’, Jara’s voice trailed off, unsure if it was a question or a stern reminder he wished to articulate. 
’I will come back’, Manal asserted. After that lie, he was lost to sex, to drugs and to that monstrosity he called music. He even remembered the stupid name of the band Manal had joined in Circadia: Anthems for Doomed Youth. 
<Anthems for Doomed Youth was a Circadian heavy metal band best known for their sophomore album On The Natural History of Destruction. With its existential cynicism and apparent joy at the idea of impending destruction, brought to life by Manal’s lyrics and insane vocal delivery <note: not singing>, its success caught everyone, including the band themselves, by surprise. Pop culture experts debated for long on how such a band could have broken out in a musical landscape that was dominated by crooning auto-tuned voices serenading those who they loved or lusted after. The dominant view, put forward by prominent philosopher and musicologist Garb Lamrec, was that it was the music that best captured the upheaval – technological, social, psychological – of the times: ’We live in a world where the word ’disrupt’ is bandied about as a badge of honour. It is an overhauling, a clearing of the cobwebs, a sometimes necessary act of purging the old and welcoming the new. The music of AoDY best captured this spirit and possibly resonated with the youthful innovators of the time. Here was music that spoke to these influential young men and women who viewed themselves as natural successors of the enlightenment era two hundred years before, who viewed their destinies as nothing less than heralding in a new renaissance. ’>    
Jara shifted his focus to Dev. Thirteen years old he was then but the aloofness in his eyes, a trait that he had since he was a child – completely incompatible within a political realm – was captured by the photographer, this man who had only walked into the room five minutes before and left five minutes after. Try as he might, Jara couldn’t recall a moment when the thought of Dev hadn’t filled his mind with some degree of disquiet.  My problem child. I only lost control of Manal in his mid-twenties, but you, you Dev, you were always the troublemaker. Right from the start. ’Do you have any fucking idea’, Jara had screamed at Dev the night of his first term inauguration, ’how stupid I look when one of my own children doesn’t come for my inauguration? Do you? ’ Dev remained quiet. ’Tell me then, why? Why? Because of that Ziromt girl? You fool! Did anyone recognize you at the airport?’ Dev shook his head. ’Are you sure?’ Jara asked again. Dev continued shaking his head. ’Then what is this?’ Jara pulled out the grainy photo and threw it at Dev’s face. It showed Dev embracing Ana in the airport, in the background a vision screen showing Jara taking his oaths. ’The only reason this won’t be on tomorrow’s papers is because the editors were kind enough to let this pass. Do you have any idea how embarrassing it would look for me? Of course you don’t! You don’t give a shit about anyone except yourself.  Here I am, taking my oaths as President of the United Tribes of Mirage while my son is busy with some –’
’Father’, Dev interjected. ’I am your son. You can scold me as much as you like and I will stand here and take it, but you won’t drag Ana’s name into this.’ Still seething at the boy’s indifference to family, Jara reacted to Dev’s new found defiance by slapping across his cheek. And then he ran away to that mad hermit in the mountain.
<INCOMING CALL>, the electronic voice of his private OVI announced. <General Facēnos. Accept call?>
’Yes’, Jara replied still spread-eagled on the floor. 
’Good morning, Mr President. I am sorry to be calling you so early.’
’That’s quite alright. I’ve been awake for a while now, General. What is it?’
‘Major Mahasen paid me a visit last night. He was...’
’Go on.’
’He wants to resign from his commission, Your Excellency.’
’Did he say why?’
’With all due respect, sir, it is fairly obvious why he wants to retire.’
’By all means then, General, enlighten me.’
’Your Excellency, Major Mahasen has been under tremendous strain since the events in Naffaj last year. You know this very well. He’s clearly stressed and wants to put the episode behind him. He thinks retiring from the army will help that process.’
’Are you telling me, General, that you accepted my son’s suggestion without my approval?’
’I wouldn’t be calling you if I did, sir.’
’Good. I am expecting Hasyl. We have a family breakfast later. I will talk him out of it.’
’Very good, Your Excellency.’
’Thank you, General. Anything else?’
The General cleared his throat. Clearly the next topic was even more awkward than the first. ’You asked me to consider the possibility of my daughter marrying Major Mahasen.’
’Have you thought it over?’
’I have.’
’And?’
’Under the circumstances, Your Excellency, I don’t think –’
’Is that a no?’
Pause. ’I wish there was-’
’That’ll be all, General.’ Jara cut the line. 
　　　　
Hasyl stopped the vehicle at the gates. <PLEASE PLACE RIGHT HAND ON SCREEN NOW>, an electronic voice spoke. Hasyl did so. <GOOD MORNING, MAJOR MAHASEN> ’Good morning, OVI’, Hasyl replied as the gate slid open. 
The Mahasen home and its surrounding front yard had changed little in its half century of existence. The driveway was a 200-yard semi-circle at the centre of which was the house. Everything was impeccably maintained. Ohiy stood at the entrance. ’You’ve gotten fat’, she said as Hasyl got down from the jeep. ’Nothing you say will stop me from hugging you, Miss Ohiy’, Hasyl retorted, walking up to her with his arms wide. ’It is good to see you, Miss Ohiy. It’s good to be back here. I’ve missed this, all of this.’ Ohiy patted his cheeks, ’It’s good to see you too, dear. Let’s go say hello to your grandmother.’ She left with him Ella as she went to supervise the rest of the housework. 
If Ella was excited to see Hasyl she barely twitched a muscle in showing it. She remained withdrawn, as if all her senses were turned inwards. ’So’, Hasyl began, ’I guess I better start by telling you what that surprise is right?’ He paused searching Ella’s face for any signs of interest. ’Okay. I am retiring from the army, grandma. I want to get into politics. I want to be by father’s side. It is time, don’t you think?’ Again, he paused more out of courtesy now. ’Right, exactly what I thought. I can’t go back there, can’t go back to the army, grandma. They are laughing, behind my back I know it, they are laughing. But it’s served me well, the army has. It opened my eyes. Out there among the natives, these others you realize they aren’t all out there fighting. Most just want three meals, their kids to be educated and the country to respect their way of life – like anyone would. And I won their respect. And I saw it is possible for us to live together, grandma. I saw it. I know it can be done.’ He paused again. ’I sound like an idealist fool, father will surely tell me, but idealists haven’t seen what I have. I can help. I know I can. I can end this before it turns to civil war.’
Ohiy was finalizing preparations when she noticed some movement behind Hasyl’s jeep. She lumbered closer and adjusted her glasses. ’Oh you frightened me, Miss Ohiy!’ Ohiy recognized the voice from behind the vehicle. ’Floa, is that you?’ ’Yes, Miss Ohiy. ’ ’What are you doing there?’ ’I dropped a coin. It rolled underneath the vehicle. Got it. ’ She stood and walked towards Ohiy. ’Where were you this morning?’ ’I apologize, Miss Ohiy. I got an urgent call from my folks at home.’ ’Is everything alright?’ ’It will be, I hope, by end of day.’ ’Fine, I understand but don’t abandon Miss Ella like that again. If you have to attend to a call, let me know so that I can be by Ella’s side during that time. Do you understand?’ ’Yes, Miss Ohiy.’ ’Good. Now help us with Miss Ella. We are going to the President’s house for breakfast.’ Floa nodded and strode out to attend to her duties. 
’A federation of self-governed states, grandma, under one central government. That will work, won’t it?’ Ella’s gaze bore past Hasyl and to the wall behind him. He sighed. ’I was hoping for a little excitement there, but I know some part of you understands what I am saying here. And I hope that part of you will give me your blessings.’ Ohiy walked in, ’Time for us to go. Your father hates it when we are late. Let’s go. Girl’, she beckoned Floa. The nurse pushed Ella’s chair along the hallway with Hasyl and Ohiy behind her. ’Did you have a good chat with your grandmother? ’ ’I did. I actually broke the surprise to her. ’ ’Will you tell me now?’ ’You are showing the impatience of a sixty-year-old,’ Ohiy pretended to whip his back with her walking stick, ’During breakfast, Miss Ohiy. I promise.’   	
Hasyl carried Ella down the stairs and into the jeep while Floa brought down the wheel chair. She loaded the wheelchair into the jeep and was about to get in her when her OVI device alerted her to an incoming call. 'Miss Ohiy', she stared. 'I am sorry, I think it is my family trying to reach me. May I please take this call?' 'We need to leave, girl. His Excellency is expecting us any moment.' 'That's alright, Miss Ohiy', Hasyl interrupted, 'You attend to your call, Floa. We'll send you a car as soon as we get there. Will you be ready in 15 minutes?' 'Yes, Major Mahasen. Thank you, I am grateful.' Hasyl waved her off and started the vehicle. 'She's a good one, that Floa', Ohiy commented as the Jeep began reversing. 'She's fantastic with grandma', Hasyl offered. Ohiy nodded in agreement. The vehicle was almost at the gates. 'Shit!' Hasyl broke the silence, '...sorry, Miss Ohiy. I left my OVI in grandma's room. Let me quickly run in and grab it.’ Hasyl turned off the vehicle and began sprinting up the driveway, into the hall, through the corridors that led to Ella's room. He noticed the OVI on the bed. He was sprinting back when he heard her voice from the adjacent room. She was crying.  He stopped running and strained to hear Floa. Failing he decided to knock on her door and see if she was alright. The door was ajar. The crying was more audible. 
'Please', she begged to the person on the other line, her back turned to Hasyl, 'Please don't make me do this. I've done everything you asked for! Please don't make me do this,’ she paused, 'Yes', seemingly answering questions, 'More than anything else. Please don't harm her. I've done everything you asked for! Sorry. Yes, I will be quiet. Yes, I want to see her again. No. No I am not having second thoughts. But those women, they've done nothing wrong. Yes. I remember. She died a horrible death. No. No I don’t think he has any regrets.'
'Are you alright?'
Hasyl's voice made her jump in fright, dropping her OVI device. The confused voice on the other end called out to her. Floa was still shaking while Hasyl tried to reassure her, 'I am sorry I frightened you, Floa. I heard you crying. Are you -'
'- what are you doing here? I saw you leave.'
'I realized I forgot my OVI. I came back and I heard you crying. Look do you want to tell your friend on the other line that you are okay. He sounds concerned.'
She leant on the wall, slid along its surface and sat on the floor with her hands on her head. 'I did everything they asked of me, but I can't do this', she buried her face. Hasyl picked up her OVI and clicked on the SPEAKER icon. 
'Hello. Thangam! Thangam!?', the voice on the other line called out. 
Hasyl cut the line. 'Who is the man on the other line? And why are you crying?'
'He has my child.'
'Is he your husband?'
'He's a monster.'
'Look I’ll help you get your child back. Stop crying.' She laughed. 'What's so funny?'
'What is funny, Major Mahasen is that you have no idea what's going on – and you want to help. Do you know if you had done your job I wouldn't be here?'
'What are you talking about?'
'Where were you that night, Major Mahasen? The night they raided my town, raped and killed my sister? Where you were when they burnt the library down? I want to know.'
'I am not going to discuss that', Hasyl stood and turned to leave. 
'My OVI. Give it to me.' Hasyl handed it back to her. 'Do you sleep at all?'
'Floa...Thangam, whatever your name is. You are crossing the line', Hasyl continued walking, aware that she was following him from behind. 
'I can't sleep, Major Mahasen. Ask me why! Ask me why!'
Hasyl stopped. He was out of the hall and could see the jeep near the gate when he turned around to address her. 'Stop. Right now. I know grief well – just as well as you do.'
'Do you? Then ask me why I can't sleep.'
Hasyl turned his back and began walking again, uninterested in the sparring. 
'I don't think you know grief, Major', she shouted, following him out of the hall and into the driveway. Hasyl turned back in annoyance, in time to see her press her OVI screen. 
Hasyl could barely remember the sound of the explosion, but he now recalled its sheer force. He felt as though a giant hand had casually flicked him away. Hasyl remembered his brief time of flight, crashing against a wall and falling on the grass. He remembered turning back and seeing the burning jeep. He remembered looking down his body and seeing countless shards of glass embedded into his left leg. He remembered the encroaching darkness that seemed to blot out the morning sun. 
　　　　
'I believe in the sanctity of sexual congress. It is the only thing I believe in. I know that now. Before I knew this, I was lost, aimless. I was desperately looking for something to believe in. And trust me I tried. I wanted to believe in the inevitability of destiny as my grandfather used to say. I wanted to believe in my destiny to succeed my father. I wanted to believe that a Mahasen is meant for public service. But then a Circadian goddess came along and showed me that there was more to life than preordained path and that there was more to sexuality than fucking. Because we don’t fuck because it is a biological need. No. To shit and piss and vomit is biological. But to fuck? That, ma'am, is spiritual. And that's what I am interested in capturing with my camera. I believe a woman in orgasm is the universe re-enacting its own creation. Her eyes a black hole whose volatility in that moment of blissful communion with another soul births all that is, all that was, and all that ever will be. So, to the ones who dismiss my art as pornographic, including members of my own family back in Mirage, I say to them I don’t give a shit. You can go ahead and print that, all of it.'
'You mentioned your family, Manal. Can I ask what your relationship with your family, particularly your father, is like especially in light of your careers as a musician and now as a photographer?'
'My relationship with my father is - well, was - fine, what you'd expect between a single father and his eldest son: sometimes strained because he was overly demanding – or I was overly relaxed about the whole thing. But I wanted to make him happy and proud of me as any son would, but I am not a political machine like he is. I lied to him about my reasons for coming to Circadia. I told him it was for my studies. But in truth it was for a woman, the aforementioned Circadian goddess. He didn't find out till it was too late. By then the band was doing well and I didn't need his money. I have two younger brothers as you probably know. I am closer with my youngest than I am with Hasyl.'
'Major Mahasen.'
'Yes.'
'Your youngest brother, Dev Mahasen, was the first Miragian on the moon. That must have been a proud moment.'
'To echo my grandfather again, it was the inevitability of destiny. I still remember when he announced to the family that he'd live on the moon one day. We laughed.'
'How old was he?'
'Seven, if memory serves.'
'Bright child.'
'Bright, yes - he made up for what Hasyl and I lacked in our studies – but he had tenacity too. You need that to accept a shitty job like his.'
'I notice that you aren’t as quick to speak about Major Mahasen.'
'Hasyl and I have fundamentally different worldviews. He believes the military is necessary for discipline. I don’t give a shit about discipline. But he is still my brother, you understand?'
'Yes, I do.'
'So, I am not going to say more than that about Hasyl.'
'But can I ask you about your reaction to the news of the Naffaj town massacre by men in your brother's unit.'
'My brother is a soldier. He isn’t a lunatic. Now can we please -'
'- No one is painting him as such. If anything, all evidence points to your brother losing command of his own men.'
'Just because he was an ineffective military leader doesn’t make him a war criminal.'
‘Those are your words, not mine.’ [Your words, not mine. ]
'Look, he is still my brother. If we are going to discuss Hasyl, we will frame all questions around his relationship to me as my brother. His military career is of little consequence to me. Excuse me’, Manal apologized as a personal aide appeared at the door. He beckoned her to enter and she whispered the message to Manal's ears. 'I am sorry', he apologized to the reporter from The Circadian Times, 'I have an urgent call to take. Will you excuse me?' 
Manal stood and walked out to his private balcony. He pressed the ANSWER button on his OVI, bracing himself to hear a voice from the past. 'Manal here.' 'Mr Mahasen', the voice on the other end sounded unfamiliar. 'Who is this?'  'I am Avlis, I am your father's personal secretary.' 'What do you want?' 'I've been instructed by your father to pass the news before it is all over the media.' 'Get to the point, Avlis.' 'I am sorry, Mr Mahasen. There's been an assassination attempt on your brother.' Manal felt nothing. 'Major Mahasen is badly injured but miraculously survived the bomb blast, but I am afraid your grandmother and the maid died.' 'Maid?' 'Yes, I think she's called Ohiy. We expect Major Mahasen to survive. I've been instructed to tell you that the funerals for your grandmother and the maid -' 'Avlis, you call Miss Ohiy a maid again and I will see that you don’t have a job by the time I get there, do you understand?' 'Yes.' 'Expect me in Mirage tomorrow.' 'Yes, Mr Mahasen.' 'And, Avlis - how is my father?' Hesitation: 'He's recovered from the shock, but he'll need family around him. I'll have a vehicle to pick you up at the airport. My condolences, Mr Mahasen.'
　　　　
The guitar riff and the cymbals descended upon the crowd like a giant wave crashing through a levee. Manal, already under the spell of the bassist, and near the loud speakers, felt its full force, and he reacted as he had never reacted before to any music: he jumped in primal, uncontrolled joy, keeping time to the band's serpentine rhythm. He followed the riff as the guitarist played variations of the original melody, he followed it as hypnotized as those children from the old tale who followed the piper. A curious thought entered Manal's head then as his body continued to shake uncontrollably: Do these musicians know that in moments such as this they hold more power in their hands, their throats and their feet than the most ambitious politician can ever come to experience? 
'What do you think?' Nnae shouted into his ear as the soundscape turned calmer. 
'They are so loud. So unbelievably loud. I have never heard anything like it', Manal shouted back into her ear as the mood of the song began to turn. Manal could feel the building of tension. They can't keep on piling like this anymore, surely? Yet, the band did, crafting a monolith made purely out of sound waves, where at its peak was the singer, the mad Sharman of this ritual, wailing the chorus into the mic. The crowd wailed along as the singer led them to the song's surprisingly gentle end. And just like that, the monolith began to disappear; all that remained was a few sparse notes as it faded way like a mist being dispersed by strong winds. The crowd screamed in approval, most throwing a hand sign that Manal didn’t recognize, but he grabbed the camera and captured the moment. He wanted to remember it. 
'What's that song called?'
'One Hundred Yearnings for Solitude', Nnae replied. 
She took Manal backstage later that night after the show. 'They are good friends. Come on, I'll introduce you', She knocked on a door that had an ANTHEMS FOR DOOMED YOUTH logo pasted on it. A thin man with an oval face and long hair appeared behind the door. It took him a few seconds to recognize her. 'Holy shit, Nnae! Guys', he turned to the people inside the room, throwing the door open, 'Nnae is here!'
The band got up and rushed to hug her. There were four of them. Nnae introduced each of them to Manal: Iric, the singer; Mik, the guitarist; Stoc, the oval-faced bassist; and Yannd, the drummer. The band invited them to join them for celebrations back at their base. 
Their base was a warehouse that served as living quarters, studio and practice hall, the guitarist told Manal in way of conversation. Inside, three girls introduced themselves to Manal and Nnae. Girlfriends, Manal guessed. The table was neatly lined with alcohol, a few pre-rolled joints, and food. 
'A toast', Iric called out, 'to our old friend Nnae. Welcome back. And to our new friend Manal. Welcome to our humble madhouse.'
Manal noted the twinkle in Nnae's eye as Iric looked in her direction.  
Wine drunk. Kanab smoked. Food consumed. 
When the music quietened, the silence was punctuated by the sound of loud sex from the cabins, metal beds banging against walls, screeching against floors. 'The echo is interesting', Manal said to which Iric laughed a like an actor who had rehearsed that laugh. Manal noticed that he was the only one of the band members without female company. As the night wore on, Manal found himself looking for Nnae in the thinning crowd, only to find her in the midst of deep conversation with Iric throughout. 
Old lovers? Even Manal's inebriated senses couldn’t dull animal jealousy.  Rolling a joint, Manal made his way to Iric and Nnae. 
'Can I butt in and offer a smoke?'
'You can do, Manal. We were just talking about you actually. It seems you've made this young lady a very happy young lady', Iric broke out that practiced grin. Manal couldn’t tell what was sincere and what was a veil.  
'I was just telling him about how we met', Nnae's tone didn’t betray the slightest guilt. Manal's mind eased. 
'Not every day we have the son of a President making merry with us', Iric said then. 'Yours is quite a story, Manal.'
'Mostly boring though, let me tell you.'
'Are you saying the story of how we met was boring?' Nnae asked, eyebrows raised. 
'No. I was saying that was the only exciting bit', he grinned and leaned in. They kissed. Her tongue briefly slithered into his mouth before parting ways. 'But honestly though, I don’t really like talking about it – '
'He doesn’t. Trust me I've tried', Nnae offered. 
' – if that's alright. I am sorry.'
'Oh hey, no need to apologize, Manal. Man. All. Are you? Or All Man? Sorry, I am drunk. I turn into a drunken parrot.'
'He does', Nnae offered again, this time looking to Manal. 
'So how do you two know each other? She's told me a lot about your band but didn’t mention she was such close friends with you guys.'
'She was probably afraid you wouldn’t approve of us mad fuckers.'
'Manal is a bit of a mad fucker too, isn’t he?' She leaned in and kissed him again, this time letting the tongue dance deeper. 'There is no other explanation for the perfect overlapping of our paths', she leaned closer then and whispered into his ear as smoke plumed out of her mouth, 'and the perfect intertwining of our bodies.' 
 'I'll give you two kids some space eh?' Iric said and walked away with that grin again. 
'Worship me', Nnae breathed into Manal's ear as they found themselves alone. 
Manal moved forward, pressing Nnae deeper into the cushioned oblivion of the couch. Tongue again, this time more leisured in its strolling. Her body shook as Manal's errant finger plunged under her skirt. 'What did I tell you?', she grabbed his wrist and pulled the finger out of her, 'I said', she clasped his neck, digging her nails into his skin, 'Worship me.' She pushed his torso downwards, his impatient hands already pulling the skirt down her legs.  Nnae pulled his hair, reigning Manal, directing him. 'Worship me, Manal. Worship me.'
Nnae’s body was a brewing storm. Wave upon wave, her shudders rippled underneath her thighs while her body creaked in anticipation of a tremendous release of energy – and when she did release, she exploded like a collage of bliss-hued vignettes. It was [At that moment ]at that moment Manal realised he had never fully appreciated the grandeur of the female orgasm. 
Nnae, unburdened from the primal feminine need to reciprocate her lover, was a woman in revelatory dance, unapologetically naked to the world, to herself, vulnerable one moment, powerful the next, giver and taker of that one miniscule point in time and space, this explosion of light that is so far away inside the vast emptiness of her eyes that men cannot simply comprehend it; in that moment, Manal understood, a woman was so powerful she was creation made flesh, blood, sound, sweat, skin, bone – and sin; for no man could experience such pleasures so intensely for so long.  
She pulled his face closer to hers. 'Do you trust me?', she asked out of breadth. 'Yes', Manal managed to splutter out as every atom of his body craved for every atom of hers, 'By Mother Mirage, yes!' he exclaimed aloud as he entered her. She pushed him aside and wrestled him into the cushion while mounting herself up. 
'Do you trust me?' she asked again as she straddled Manal. 
'Fuck me! Yes, Nnae. I trust you', he said thrusting upwards. Nnae's entire body inhaled as Manal watched a single drop of sweat on her neck, shuddering uncontrollably from the rumblings underneath. 'Don't question anything that happens in the next few hours’, she said while thrusting down hard when she wanted to emphasize a word. 
She got off him and stripped naked. 'Come with me', she led Manal through the warehouse. In every room, someone was on the verge of a lazy, drunken climax. Nnae continued leading him to a room on a loft up a staircase. She knew where the lights were. She pushed Manal on the bed and grabbed his wrists, bringing them together over his head. Nnae then calmly opened the bed side drawer, pulled out a pair of handcuffs and fastened his wrists to the bed post. 'Trust me', she said as her lips and tongue made their way down his torso, and again before her lips parted. All life, all gravity rushed downwards for Manal. 
‘You do that now’, Manal said grunting, ‘And I’ll have no choice but to fuck you until we both lose our minds.’
‘Do it’, she said, stopping briefly from her explorations. 
‘Nae, we are on someone else’s bed!’, Manal tried protesting. 
‘Do it.’
The voice was a man’s: Iric walked in naked and closed the door. 
The night was a blur of sweat, hair and ejaculate. When Manal woke up, he found himself passed out near the edge of the bed, his hands still handcuffed to the bed post, Nae asleep on Iric’s chest, and an odour that he knew wasn’t Nae’s. He longed to vomit but the urge to cry was stronger. 
‘Not quite “love-making”, no?’, Iric whispered. Manal turned over and realized Iric wasn’t asleep or hadn’t been for a while - and was watching Manal. But it was the comment that hit Manal; when Nae and he had started their secret meetings, he had innocently referred to their most carnal acts as ‘love-making’. ‘What we are doing isn’t quite love-making, Mr Mahasen’, Nae would tease before hurling her naked body at his. 
‘Where are the keys?’
Iric looked confused at first. ‘Right – the handcuff. It’s in the drawer by your side. 
‘I can’t reach it’, Manal mouthed the words slowly.
‘Well I can’t either – unless you want me to get up and wake Nae up in the process. Look at her: she’s sleeping like a drunk baby.’ Iric paused, watching Manal try desperately to reign in the emotional outburst that was longing to come, and grinned again. Manal had started to hate that grin. ‘I am joking, this thing doesn’t have a key. You can unlock it with your thumb like so’, he mimicked the action. Manal felt blood return to his wrists again. In the bathroom, Manal sank to his knees as he vomited and shat at the same time while forcing himself not to sob. Outside, he heard the bed banging rhythmically against the other side of the wall and a hungover Nae clumsily beg Iric, ‘Make me come before he gets back’. 
　　　　
Try as he might, Manal would never be able to forget that smell. 
<As he got older, he’d adorn himself in increasingly strong perfumes and sanitary cleaners to kill the olfactorily illusion that he stank of a combination of faeces, vomit, urine, sweat and semen – so much so that he would objectively lose his sense of smell in a few decades while his mind continued convincing him that a rancid ghost clung on to him every moment of every day, whispering ‘Your stench will haunt the living and the dead.’>  
‘Buckle your seat belts please, Mr Mahasen. We are about to land.’ 
Even in his extremely sanitized private jet, 30,000 feet above the ground, heading straight to all that grief, the smell lingered. He buckled his seat belts. 
Avlis was waiting for him at the VIP lounge. Manal no longer expected to whisk through an airport unseen – this was the cost he had to pay for the ridiculous success in two separate careers. If Avlis disapproved of Manal’s highly progressive, cutting-edge Circadian fashion choices, he didn’t show it. He greeted and introduced himself with a sombre tone. ‘Mr Mahasen, I didn’t fully appreciate who Miss Ohiy was, and what she meant to your family. I am truly sorry I got off on a bad note by calling her that word.’ Manal was impressed, but didn’t show it. That word ‘maid’ had rung in his head since that phone conversation. He hated Avlis from that moment, but this career bureaucrat now surprised him. ‘It’s alright. Miss Ohiy was back stage for so long, people outside the family had no idea. Tell me: did the papers refer to her as that? A maid?’ 
‘In every public release of the attack and the subsequent funeral, we’ve referred to Miss Ohiy as a close cousin of your grandmother. I made sure of that, Mr Mahasen.’ 
Impressive. Manal nodded and walked ahead. ‘Should I expect media outside?’, he asked before opening the door.
‘We informed editors of all the dailies to stay away.’ 
The drive was initially silent. Avlis had the tact to let Manal stew in the rising grief that would inevitably erupt in the next few hours. ‘Where are we headed, Avlis?’ 
‘To the Presidential Palace’. 
‘What about our family home?’
‘The front of the house is badly damaged from the blast, Mr Mahasen. The PSD won’t allow anyone from the President’s family to go near the place until they’ve completely scoured it for…well’
‘More bombs?’
‘It’s a security risk, Mr Mahasen. They aren’t taking any more chances with the first family’s security. They’ll have much to answer for after your father is done with the funeral rites.’ 
‘Where’s Hasyl?’
‘Major Mahasen is in hospital. He’s stable, but the medical team want to keep him for observations for another day or so.’
‘How is he?’
Avlis inhaled. ‘He’s inconsolable. He won’t see anyone. Not even your father.’ 
‘Take me to him.’ 
‘But, Mr Mahasen –‘
‘Avlis, you have no choice on the matter.’
‘But your father’s –‘
‘My father’s orders aren’t to forcibly bring me to him – or has he become that much of an ego maniac?’
‘No, it’s just that –‘
This continued until the car drove in to the hospital. ‘I can’t guarantee that you’ll see Major Mahasen. He’s made it very clear he doesn’t want to see anyone, especially not family.’ 
Manal ignored him and walked into the lobby. Immediately eyes widened. Some gawked. The receptionist voice cracked as she struggled to remember what room and ward Major Mahasen was admitted in. ‘Look, Mr Mahasen. There’s protocol that needs to be followed in these matters.’ 
‘I was just beginning to like you, Avlis. Pity.’ 
They turned to a wide corridor that had VIP printed in beautifully inappropriate typography. Manal walked to the door that had PSD standing outside. They stepped in front of his path and shook their heads even before he got close. ‘I need to see my brother’, Manal was strangely calm. ‘What’s it going to take, eh lads?’, he fished out his wallet. Inside was mostly Circadian money. He threw the bills in their faces. ‘Here, take it. Circadian money. More than you’ll earn in a fucking year. Take it and move the fuck out of my way.’ They stood motionless and unimpressed.
‘What’s it going to take to get these monkeys to move, Avlis?’, Manal bellowed. 
‘Treat them with some respect for starters, Mr Mahasen’, Avlis stood behind. He motioned for Manal to move aside. He then spoke to them in hushed voice. A minute later, he turned to Manal, ’10 minutes if he agrees to see you – if. If he doesn’t, I’ll take you straight to presidential palace. No ifs and buts. Agree?’
The lights were turned down inside Hasyl’s room. Manal could hear light snoring in the shadows. As he was turning up the lights, Hasyl stirred. ‘Turn it down, how many times do I have to tell you people I have –‘, it was then Hasyl turned his head and saw Manal. Silence as the two brothers sized up one another for the first time in years. 
‘What the fuck are you wearing?’ 
‘Good to see you too.’
‘You look like an ostrich. And smell like a rich gypsy.’ 
‘I am not rich – I am wealthy. There’s a difference. You Miragians still can never seem to tell the difference.’ 
‘Well, fuck me. My leg’s blown to bits, I am going to be on a wheelchair for the rest of my life, and now I have to listen to economics lecures from my big brother.’ 
‘I was told you were inconsolable.’ 
‘This is me being inconsolable.’ 
‘Why haven’t you let father come see you?’ 
‘Why are you are worried about father’s feelings, suddenly?’
‘Do we have to do this now? I came here to grieve, Hasyl. Can I grieve? Can we? Maataach is gone. Ohiy –‘, Manal’s voice finally cracked. 
‘It’s my fault’, Hasyl said quietly. ‘This is all my fault.’ 
Anger and heart-break were fighting inside Manal. ‘You fucker. You’ve not changed, have you? Still need something or someone to blame. I’suppose the logical end of the road is when you start blaming yourself. Stupid fucker’, before he knew what he was doing, Manal found himself hugging Hasyl. For the first time since the day their mother died, the brothers cried in each other’s arms.  
Manal took a seat, wiping away his tears. 
‘Have you seen father since you returned?’
‘I just got in this afternoon. Came straight to you.’ 
‘Father needs someone around him.’
‘I’ll go see him after this. It won’t be easy.’
‘And Dev? Does he know?’, he paused. ‘Does he care?’ 
Dev and I are in touch. He takes time to respond. I passed the news. Haven’t heard from him yet.’ 
‘What’s he so busy with?’
‘I don’t know. Moon work?’ 
‘I really fucked him up too, didn’t I?’
‘Stop it.’
‘No, I mean I kept saying he killed mother. He was just a kid.’
‘You were an asshole. And now you are a self-aware asshole. Progress. Look, Dev’s not just shy or introverted or estranged from the family. I think he genuinely loathes most human interaction – why else would someone grab that shit job and be by themselves in that hellscape? Both you and father have to take blame for that. 
‘When all this is over, I’d like to talk to him. To say sorry.’
This was getting way too much for Manal. Cracks don’t repair themselves overnight. Even if Hasyl had seemingly turned the corner, it’d take years to get Dev to overcome the childhood trauma of an older brother constantly accusing him of killing their mother, and thereafter forgive Hasyl. 
‘All in good time’, Manal lied, already knowing Dev would scoff at the notion of reconciling with Hasyl and father. ‘We have to cremate our Mahasen women first.’ There was a knock on the door. ‘I am coming!’, Manal stood. ‘I promised them 10 minutes. I have to go see father now. I’ll come get you for the funeral, okay?’
Hasyl nodded. ‘I don’t know if I can do it.’ 
‘If you don’t, you are going to hate yourself for the rest of your life.’ 
‘I already do.’
‘I’ll get you help. Circadian doctors who treat this sort of thing.’ 
‘What, self-loathing?’ 
‘Survivors’ guilt. PTSD. Depression.’
‘How do you know these things?’ 
‘Therapy. Lots of it. It helped me. It’ll help you.’
‘You’d do that?’
‘You are still my brother, you fucker.’
‘I didn’t expect our reunion to be this, well I wasn’t expecting a reunion at all, but I didn’t expect one so.…what’s the word I am looking for?’
‘Surreal. The word you are looking for is surreal’, Manal said and walked out of the room. 
The drive from the hospital to the Presidential palace was less argumentative as Avlis gave Manal space. As they turned into the palace, Manal made a mental note to not let his emotions get the better of him this time around. There’d be no tearful reunion, of that he was sure. 
Jara, watching from the window of his office, felt something flutter when he saw the strange, lanky man with the long, braided hair and heavy beard, step out of the car. Mother Mirage! It was one thing to see the monstrosity in photos and in video, but another to see it in real life. This is where all that money went? For him to walk around looking like a Circadian clown? 
Manal was ushered in, taken through the hall way, through a few wide corridors and into the residential wing. Manal had been at the palace a few times after his father’s first electoral victory; nothing impressed him fifteen years ago, nothing about it impressed him now. The palace was a poor nation’s attempt at pomp and grandiosity, to show off to the world. Portraits of past presidents, The Trinity, and important foreign dignitaries in choreographed poses with Jara. Miragian lined the hallway, leading to Jara’s private office. Interesting, no pictures of paataach. He made a mental note of the final observation. 
The PSD at the door raised their eyebrows as this eccentrically dressed man walked up to them, flanked by a man, comically juxtaposed, in standard bureaucrat-wear. Manal ignored them as the Avlis knocked on the door. 
Jara had just sat at his desk when he heard the tap. ‘Come.’ 
Avlis stepped in first, closed the door, came out a minute later and nodded to Manal. ‘He’ll see you now.’ 
Jara pretended to read a document as Manal was let in. He didn’t lift his eyes off the document even as his eldest son walked back into Jara’s life for the first time in 15 years. Manal, for his part, didn’t wait to be invited to sit. 
‘Most people have the courtesy to wait until I invite them to sit’, Jara said, his eyes still on the paper. 
‘Most people grieve when loved ones are taken away cruelly.’
Jara snorted, ‘Leaves home with my money, doesn’t come back, doesn’t keep in touch with his family, but is now lecturing me about grief.’ 
‘Put that paper down father. If you are going to be snide, at least have the decency to do it to my face.’ 
‘If I put this down, snide remarks will be the least of your worries’, Jara tried to mimic the ice-cold tone with which he had disciplined Manal since childhood. 
It was Manal’s turn to snort, ‘Threatening a grown man, are we?’ 
‘No, attempting to discipline him. Much like a kennel master with a mad dog.’
‘Is this why you wanted me here? Did you get everything off your chest? Does this feel good?’
‘I’ll feel better when you pay me back for the money you stole.’ 
‘I didn’t steal anything. You gave me it me for my studies.’ 
‘And this’, Jara snapped, throwing the paper on the floor and pointing at Manal, ‘is the result? You look like you work in a circus! I gave the money to you because you lied. You made it sound like you had finally grown up.’
Manal’s face had turned to stone. ‘Fuck this family’, he muttered while shaking his head. ‘We aren’t going to grieve like normal people, but we are going to bicker over money? At a time like this? You want your money?’
‘Fuck this family? Well this family considered you dead when you lied to me and stole my money.’ 
Manal had had enough. He stood and took his OVI out, ‘You want the money? Well you can have it. OVI’, he addressed the device. ‘I want to transfer funds into a Miragian bank account.’
‘Certainly’, the device said. ‘Please stand still as I verify biometrics.’
‘Right, how much do I owe you? You gave me 50,000 Circadian Rūpyas? No, I am feeling generous. OVI what is the amount owed for 100,000 Circadian Rūpyas at, I don’t know, 30% interest for 15 years?’ 
‘12%’, Jara interjected. ‘Does Circadian education not cover basic economics?’ 
‘Oh no no, father, you started this, I am going to end this on my terms.’
‘5,118,589 Rūpyas’, OVI announced. 
‘Wonderful. Transfer that amount to my father’s bank account at the Miragian National Savings Bank.’ 
‘What are you doing?’, Jara’s eyes widened. 
‘Ending this how I should have ended this years ago’, Manal said, a manic smile on his face. 
‘Transfer complete’, the device said a few seconds later. 
‘Isn’t technology amazing, father? A snap of my thumb, and you’ve made more money than 15 years as Miragian president. Have fun explaining that to the state auditors’, Manal turned and walked to the door. ‘I’ll see you at the funeral – you do remember that there’s a funeral tomorrow, right? You fucking prick.’ 
Manal slammed the door on his way out where Avlis was waiting for him. ‘Are you loyal to my father, Avlis?’ 
‘What?’ 
‘Are you loyal to my father?’ 
‘Yes, of course I am.’ 
‘Does he value it?’ 
‘Sorry?’
‘Does he value your loyalty?’ 
Jara, hearing the commotion outside his private office, stepped out. 
Manal pointed at him, ‘What does this bean-counting prick pay you for your loyalty?’ 
Avlis had expected the day to be awkward but now it had gone off the rails. ‘I am not liberty to divulge – ‘
‘Well whatever it is, I’ll double it. Leave him and come work for me in Circadia as my private secretary. You’ll have a nice Circadian home, vehicle, chauffeur, bring your family, bring a girlfriend if you like’, he then turned to Jara. ‘Maataach is gone. So is Ohiy. By the time I am done in this trip, everyone you trust will leave you – and that includes Hasyl. Yeah, that’s right: I spoke to him. He saw me. Your favourite child’s leg is blown to smithereens, and the only one from the family he’d see is me. Not you. I hope you die alone and miserable, Jara Mahasen.’ 
As Manal stormed out, Avlis running behind him in a bid to calm the situation down, Jara knew he’d never see his son again. Was it heartbreak that he was feeling? Was he numb? He knew tragedy well, but this was new. This was murky, a clotting up of his psyche the likes of which even his father’s death hadn’t prepared him for. He wanted to weep. He wanted to shout. He wanted vengeance on those who dared to hurt his family. But mostly, Jara Mahasen just wanted to sleep, but now the nightmares would have new material to work with – he wouldn’t give it the opportunity to wreck him. Sleep will have to wait. 
Having sped off, Manal was by himself in the vehicle. He instructed the vehicle to take him to the funeral parlour where the bodies were being finalized for public display. It’d be a closed casket affair. All Manal wanted to do was to grieve, but so far, he had tended to his broken brother and burnt the last remaining bits of a bridge to his father. 
The undertakers weren’t expecting anyone from the family, but reacted like undertakers do when he turned up at the reception; they knew who he was and, after a brief discussion, allowed him for private time with the bodies. 
‘Mr Mahasen, the temptation will be there to open the casket and say goodbye. It’s only natural to do so, but for your sake – and the dignity of these two women – we strongly urge you to refrain’, saying that, they left the room.
Manal dragged the chair to be closer to the caskets. He had forgotten to ask which casket had his grandmother, and which one housed Ohiy. He contemplated calling the undertaker in and verifying but he didn’t want to talk to anyone. 
‘I don’t know what we are going to do without you in our lives. The evidence of the last few hours isn’t great. Father and I are done for good. Hasyl is broken, body and spirit – I’ll do my best to fix him but you were his anchor too. That’s the thing; no matter how much we fought among ourselves, all of us Mahasen boys loved you. Our rock. I don’t know how you did it. I couldn’t. We throw ourselves into the fire, this family, emerge surprised that we are burnt and broken, and expect those around us to pretend like all this is normal. I couldn’t do it. I still don’t know if I can. And I am one of them! No matter how much I fight against it, I am still a Mahasen. I promise you I am going to do better with Hasyl. I’ll bring Dev back into the fold too. It’s the least I can do’. Manal paused. There was so much he wanted to tell her. ‘I am sorry for not being in touch. I just didn’t want to put you in a position where father would be annoyed with you for being in touch with me. Did you know he thinks I stole–‘, he paused again, suppressing a sob that seemed to bubble from deep inside but it was too late. ‘I don’t know what we are going to do without you. 30 years ago, when mother died, I was so scared that we’d drift away and become strangers inside that fucking house. We didn’t. And that was because of you. But it was always inevitable. And now it’s here. I’ll fight the inevitable because that’s what you’d want me to do. Thank you for everything you did for me. For us. We could never begin to repay you, but now we’ve also failed to protect you. I wanted so much to take you to Circadia and live with me there. I wanted your last years to be peaceful and serene with rest being your only responsibility. You would have hated it, that lazy, unhurried, all convenience Circadian life, but I’d have made you come around. Forgive me for my faults over the years. I am trying. I am trying to be a better man, every day. You were the best of us. I’m performing your final rites tomorrow – I hope you’d approve. I love you, Miss Ohiy. Rest in Peace.’ 
He stood and contemplated opening the caskets, but he knew it’d shatter him senseless. 
He spent a restless few hours in bed but when sleep didn’t come, he decided on a late-night drink. The streets of the capital city had changed drastically in the last decade. Painted signages had transformed into garish neon lights that were all the rage in Circadia a few decades back. Only night owls and the army were on the streets – all too tired or too drunk to realize one of the most famous men in the world, the eldest son of the president, was walking among them. In some of the dimly lit neighbourhoods, prostitutes smoked and struck tired poses. ‘Show you good times, handsome?’, one asked as he walked past her. 
‘No’, Manal said, ‘but join me for a drink? I’ll pay.’ 
‘You buy drink then nothing more than-‘, she mimicked a handjob. 
‘- No, no. I don’t want that. Or anything. Just your company’, Manal clarified. 
‘I am whore, sweetie. Not girlfrie-‘
Manal placed a wad of notes in her hand, ‘Here. Now will you join me?’ 
‘You strange, sweetie’, she said, taking the notes and putting into her bag. ‘Buy me a drink then.’
Since nothing was opened, they walked back to the hotel he was staying in. He ordered room service and invited her into his suite. 
She whistled as she saw the size of the suite and sheer opulence of its interiors. ‘Fancy sweetie, you!’ 
Manal shrugged. He was pouring the drink. 
‘What’s on your mind, stranger?’, she asked after they toasted. ‘Someone die?’ 
Manal ignored the question and sat. They drank in silence. 
‘I can’t sleep nights’, Manal began, ‘if I don’t fuck.’
Her head titled like a confused dog. ‘You fuck every night?’
‘Yes. Every night.’
‘Same’, she said and laughed at her own joke. ‘Do you want to fuck now?’
Manal hesitated. ‘Yes, but I am trying not to.’ 
‘Then what’s all this?’
‘I don’t know.’ 
‘You pay already. Wait’, she paused: ‘D’you want to fuck – or get fucked?’ 
The next morning, Manal woke to Avlis at the door. He let him in and walked around naked to shower and then dress. Avlis didn’t flinch, but his expression changed slightly when he saw the scattered clothes and a woman on the bed. He said nothing until Manal came out dressed, his hair tied to a bun, and in the customary white required for Miragian funerals, ‘I wish your father could see you now.’ 
‘Why?’ 
He hesitated, ‘He told me to decline your request to perform Miss Ohiy’s funeral rites on account of…your fashion choices.’ 
‘It wasn’t a request, Avlis. You know this very well.’ 
‘I do, but I was briefing him on the funeral arrangements – and this came up.’ 
‘Who’s going to perform the rites for Miss Ohiy then?’
‘Major Mahasen.’ 
‘Major Mahasen. Fuck’s sake. Does my father even know his favourite has to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair?’ 
‘I asked him the same thing.’ 
‘And?’
‘Hasyl just has to place the flame on the pyre. Everything else, he’ll do – for both women.’ 
Manal shook his head in disbelief at his father’s pettiness, ‘I’ll talk to Hasyl – don’t worry, Avlis, you won’t get in trouble on our account.’ 
Hasyl had been discharged from the hospital and gone to his residences where he had a full-time nurse and around the clock security. Army security needed time to be convinced that this strange looking man was indeed Major Mahasen’s brother. Avlis waited by the vehicle. 
This was the first time Manal had been in Hasyl’s home. The insides was sparse except for framed photographs and newspaper cut-outs. Manal was struck by one he hadn’t seen before: it showed his father, holding Hasyl and Manal on either side, silhouetted against a funeral pyre. Full circle Manal thought to himself as Hasyl was wheeled into the living room. 
‘Why aren’t you dressed yet?’
Hasyl made no eye contact. He had a newspaper in his hand which he threw in Manal’s direction. 
It was The Miragian. On it, under the front-page news, was an innocuous looking headline. It had Manal’s name. ‘MANAL MAHASEN: (MY) BROTHER IS “INEFFECTIVE MILTARY LEADER – NOT A WAR CRIMINAL.’ His hands shook in rage.
‘What the fuck do you know about warfare?’, Hasyl asked, his gaze still averted. 
‘Hasyl, this is a misunderstanding. They’ve picked a quote out of-‘ 
‘Answer my question: what the fuck do you know about war? About the military? What the fuck do you know about putting life on the line, Manal?’ 
‘Hasyl, listen to me. We can discuss this straight after the funeral, I promise.’
‘Answer my question’, Hasyl’s voice was strangely calm, his gaze still elsewhere. 
‘I know nothing.’
‘Then who’, he finally turned towards Manal, ‘the fuck are you to be passing judgement on my military career?’ 
‘I am sorry, Hasyl. I can explain this.’ 
Hasyl was shaking his head even before Manal was done with the sentence. ‘No. No. You’ve explained enough. Take your faggot presence back to Circadia. I don’t ever want to see or hear from you again’, he turned to the nurse who seemed to have frozen in awkwardness at what she was witnessing. ‘Show him out’, he told her. 
‘Hasyl, come on now! There’s a funeral, and you are performing the final rites for Miss Ohiy.’ 
‘Guards!’, Hasyl shouted as he was being wheeled away. ‘Show my guest out. I don’t want him let in again.’ 
Avlis knew something was off when he saw Manal got in and slammed the door shut. ‘I am going to ask you a question and for once I don’t want your response to be another question. Clear?’
Avlis nodded his head. 
‘Did you have anything to do with that headline on The Miragian?’
‘I didn’t even read the papers today so I have no idea what you are on about, but I don’t oversee the press. Your father has a Propaganda Department for that.’ 
‘Let’s go’, Manal ordered. 
The smell of incense and rosewater was strong at the cemetery. The caskets were laid out in a pyre built to accommodate two. The portraits of the two women in front. His father, flanked by the PSD, some minsters, civil servants, and party loyalists were there. Manal noticed his mother’s family hadn’t turned up. So, this is it? This is family? A bunch of politicians and bureaucrats? 
A Samanian priest walked around with a bell, ringing it every time he finished circling the pyre. <Miragian funerals have three variants, depending on which First Ancestor’s tribe a Miragian’s lineage traced back to. The Samanian tradition, to which the Mahasens belonged to, was minimalist – in that it required only one priest – but it lasted the longest. A Samnian priest had to go around the pyre clockwise equal to the number of remaining blood relatives. If there was 40, he’d have to do 40 rounds. The Mahasen Matriarch required only four – for Jara, Manal, Hasyl and Dev. Since Ohiy didn’t have blood relatives, she wouldn’t get any. That problem was solved by the double pyre.> 
When he had finished, the priest chanted the funeral prayer, calling out the names of the surviving relatives, punctuating each name call by lighting a fresh wick and laying it inside an oil lamp. The fires of the wicks combined to form the flame that would then light the torch used to finally light the pyre. The priest called Jara’s name and handed him the torch to be lit. Jara lit the torch and turned to face the pyre. 
Bare-chested and covered in rosewater, Jara shivered as the wind picked up. A storm was forming. ‘Hurry’, the priest pushed him towards the pyre. Jara lit it, twice – making sure to push the flame into the separate compartments of the two caskets. When he was done, he turned and scanned the faces of everyone in attendance. He didn’t know half their names. His eyes met Manal’s just as the crowd began to disperse. Father and son, flanked by PSD and Avlis, stood watching the pyre slowly crumble and crackle. 
‘Why did you do it?’, Manal asked. 
‘Hasyl is all I have. You can’t take him away from me’, Jara said. Both their attention was on the pyre. 
‘You are willing to humiliate one son to get back at another. You are willing to break a very fragile relationship between your sons, just so you can have your way’, Manal shook his head in disbelief. ‘I can’t do this with you anymore. Don’t look in the mirror, Jara. You won’t like what you’ve become.’ 
Manal walked to the vehicle where Avlis was already waiting for him. 
‘Why are you still here, Avlis?’ 
‘Your father asked me to be by your side from the moment you land until the moment you leave.’
‘A nanny then?’, Manal asked as he got in. Avlis got in front. 
‘Where to, Mr Mahasen?’ 
‘I want to see the house one more time. I want to spend some time inside it.’ 
The vehicle made its way to the old Mahasen home. The PSD had given their clearance and now as they drove in, for the first time since the blast, Manal saw what destruction the bomb had wrought on his childhood home. The façade was covered by a tarp to cover its blackened face. Window frames were mangled. Workers were busy clearing the rubble, and sanitizing the driveway and the walls where burnt flesh had left visible stains. 
‘Stay here, Avlis.’
<It’d be the last time Manal would step inside his family home. The next day, he flew back to Circadia, vowing to never return.> 
　　　　







<Nomad: The Eternal Journey of the Dom People, BY ANAKA-ODONATA ZIROMT, Pg 35>  
Those who run away from their lives, as I did when I chose to join the Štar clan’s pilgrimage, have little time to choose what they take with them. I had even less choice, hundreds of miles as I was from my home. I had packed clothes for a week and my OVI tablet when leaving for the desert town. These, along with Fifty Rūpya in cash, were all I had that reminded me of my previous life. 
The tablet, much to my surprise, became the most useful. Let me explain. I have always entertained a natural distance between myself and technology. I am not in any way suggesting that I was resistant to it, but that I was afraid I’d be transfixed by the screen that was no longer a window to our real world but a newer, virtual world we were building sans the ugliness, sanitized, homogenous, and with a logo attached to it all. Still, pragmatism won over: OVI tablets proved to be useful in my studies and indeed I took it to Sikar in the first place to help with voice-recording of interviews and other tasks I might be assigned during our week-long interaction with the Dom.  As I packed on the morning I was to leave Sikar with the Štar clan, I wondered what was sillier: a diplomat’s daughter considering running away with a nomadic tribe or she running away with nomads, with her most useless possession in hand. 
I didn’t expect much use of it. There’d be no wireless signals for it to pick up (though I had no plans to be on OVI as I traversed the desert). During the first three months I had barely taken it out of the bag, preferring to spend as much time with my new friends, especially Di and children her age. 
I must admit that I grew to be quite fond of Di very quickly – a relationship that has only strengthened as she has grown into a wonderful young woman. One evening, as Di slept on my lap, Štar, stroking Di’s hair, said, ‘You fond of this little one, girl.’ 
‘Yes, I am. She is the first friend I made here’, I paused, adding with a wink, ‘After you that is.’ 
She didn’t smile back and I wondered why: Štar was very generous with her mirth. She was clearly troubled.
‘Are you alright, Štar?’ 
She nodded, slowly. ‘Thinking’ 
‘What about?’ 
‘Miragians believe in coincidence?’   
‘I can’t speak for all Mirage. Me? No.’ 
She continued nodding her head as if she was listening to a song only she could hear. 
‘Why?’, I asked. 
‘The two of you no coincidence’ 
This puzzled me. ‘I don’t understand, Štar’ 
‘I do?’ With that, she rose. ‘Sleep, girl. See Lord Hexa tomorrow. He will know.’ 
Udupi was our last stop before we set off on the final leg of the journey, a hundred miles south to the shores of Lake Circadia. A truly remote village nestled in the heart of the mountains and home to one hundred families or so, it is, at first sight, little different to the countless hamlets that we’d already passed through. But as you venture towards this village through the Ghats, you come to inevitably know his name. If memory serves me right, I first came to know of him because of a spray-painted wall. We were passing through the town of Valsad, about 300 miles north, and on the front wall of a school was his likeness, spray-painted by an overzealous youth. 
The painting itself was shoddy, but it was the conceptual underpinning that I was drawn to; the long-haired warrior had not one but six heads and six pairs of hands, each bearing a weapon. I remembered even then struggling to reconcile his apparently cherubic face with the overt implications of violence. I dismissed it from my mind, but found variations of the same symbolism recurring throughout our journey. Sometimes it’d be another spray-painted wall, sometimes a hastily stuck poster on a mile-post, more than once I saw it on t-shirts. My curiosity piqued I asked Štar who this six-headed man was. 
‘He warrior prince, but he choose to live quiet life in mountains. We will see him in Udupi.’ 
‘Why six heads and six pairs of hands?’ 
‘You will see’, was her cryptic response. 
I was, then, admittedly excited at the prospect of meeting this individual who seemed to inspire naked idolatry among rural populations along the Ghats. I rose early the next morning and made my way down the river with Di. As she was bathing, I sat on a rock and took my OVI out for the first time since I left Sikar. I hadn’t read anything since then and wanted to pick something up from my virtual library and read a few pages that day.
‘What that, Dragonfly?’ Di, wading in a calm pool of water by the rocks, shouted over the rumble of the rushing water behind her. How do you explain an electronic tablet to a child who knew only a nomadic life?
‘I’m reading a book’, I replied, no conviction in my voice. 
Di laughed. ‘I see books before. This no book.’
I explained to her how this ‘book’ allowed me to read any book I wanted, simply by pressing a button. 
‘Books heavy’, Di retorted. 
This went on for a while until Di, unconvinced by my answers, went on a new line of inquiry: ‘What does book say?’
I told her. The questioning continued – my OVI opened at the last book I was reading in Sikar, the late Yara Mahasen’s unpublished A History of Time and Time Again, and Di’s curiosity found me desperately trying to recall details of the story – until it reached its logical climax: ‘I wish I read story, it wonderful’, Di said.
This simple statement hit me like a tremendous wave. During those first months travelling with the Štar clan, I often asked myself how I could be more useful to these people who, for no reason other than the goodness of their hearts, had allowed me to accompany them. They had fed me, given me shelter and taught me much of their way of life. What was I going to do in return? Every full moon, as the pilgrimage closed in on Lake Circadia, I would mull this question in my head. Out here, I was useless. There was nothing of note I could share, I thought. But now I knew. 
I beckoned Di to come out of the water and sit next to me. ‘Would you like me to teach you to read?’ She nodded, her enthusiasm quite obvious. Why had I not realized this before? I rebuked myself.  We had our first lesson by the river that day. 
Sometime later we made our way back to the camp. Štar, Di and I by her side, led the rest of the clan to the village. I have already alluded in earlier sections about the sheer crudeness (sometimes cruelty) with which the Dom are sometimes received by so-called civilized societies. Udupi, I was happy to note, was one of the few exceptions. If anything, the residents of the village hardly paid us any heed, their attention grabbed by the events around a hut at the end of the path. The excitement in the crowd was palpable. 
I carried Di and let her sit on my shoulders so she could get a better view.
‘See nothi –‘, Di said when I asked her what she could see. ‘Wait –‘
‘What?’
‘Big bird with feathers and snake outside door.’
This didn’t make any sense. The crowd hushed. 
‘Bird moving, Dragonfly!’
‘What bird?’ 
‘Is blue feathers like rainbow behind.’
A peacock? I wondered. ‘Bird coming close – now snake!’
I looked around, trying to sense if the crowd was on the verge of panic. No. 
‘Some come out hut, Dragonfly.’
She was excited and almost jumping having forgotten that she was sitting on my shoulders. ‘Two women, Dragonfly!’ The crowd was still hushed. Most had their palms clasped together and open, as in prayer. I sought Štar out from the crowd. 
‘Dragonfly, look man from picture!’
A chant seemed to explode from within the crowd. 
Arohara! The crowd affirmed out aloud. Arohara! They repeated, their hands closed and above their heads. I managed to locate Štar in the midst of the throng. 
The ceremony seemed to go on for a while and I am sparing you, dear reader, of any further description because I saw none of it – only hearing commentary from my young companion. When it ended, the crowd gathered in a long, orderly queue. Štar had us also join one of the long lines. As we moved up the queue, I could better make out the two women, the man, and indeed the bird (yes, it was a peacock) and the snake which had by now coiled around the man’s neck and – forgive my unqualified observation – seemed to be asleep. The man was evidently at ease because he paid the serpent little attention. The queue, I saw now, led a large table arranged with food: the man and the two women were presenting parcels of food to the entire village. 
I turned around to Štar: ‘Does this happen every day?’ 
‘No’
‘Why today then?’
‘Hexa married. This wedding.’
‘Who did he get married to?’ 
‘Both’, she referred to the women flanking him. 
It was now my turn. I walked towards Hexa. The spray-painted walls, posters and t-shirts exaggerated many things – he did not, for instance, have six heads or six pairs of hands; but his youthful face wasn’t an embellishment. I hazarded a guess at his age: twenty-five? Thirty? But there was a gravitas of an old man that was immediately apparent. 
‘You are not from our village, are you, sister?’ the fluency with which he spoke Circadanese jolted me from my reverie; I hadn’t heard that language since the day I joined the walk. His voice also belied his face: gravelled and throaty, the voice of a compulsive smoker. 
‘Girl with us, Lord Kartikeya’, Štar interjected. 
‘Step forward, sister’, he handed me the food, packed neatly in giant banana leaves. ‘You are most welcome here.’ 
‘Thank you, Lord Kartikeya’, I spluttered. 
Di and I moved along after receiving our parcels of food. We looked around and saw those who stood in front of us had unpacked their parcels under shady trees and begun eating. We joined them. The food – rice, lentil stew and an assortment of vegetable curries – wasn’t merely delicious, but a feast for all the senses. As we ate, I noticed the wives making their way to us. ‘Friends!’ one of them exclaimed in Dom as they got closer. Štar and the rest of the clan stood. ‘Friends, honour us by coming to wedding. Thank you.’ Štar bowed and I followed. She turned towards me. Štar pointed, ‘Is Dragonfly. And this’, she looked towards the child, ‘one Di.’ 
‘Dragonfly and Di – lovely pair you make’, one of the women said smiling. She had longer hair and a wider hip, and, bending down, carried Di. ‘You pretty one’. Her companion was noticeably younger, perhaps no older than me. ‘I Valli’, the younger one said. ‘And this my sister Teyvanai. Our husband like to see three of you.’ Confused, I turned to Štar. She took my hand and we made our way to the hut. At its entrance stood, as Di had accurately described earlier, the peacock and the snake. The snake was alert and almost seemed to be guarding the entrance of the hut. The peacock was brooding a little further away in the front yard. Seeing Teyvanai and Valli, the snake slithered aside and the bird, eyes boring into us strangers, stepped aside. 
The hut was sparse: a large bed at the far side the only noticeable furniture. There were no chairs, no boxes, nothing. The ladies continued walking straight through the main room of the hut towards a door that led to a backyard that itself seemed to lead into a rainforest. We came out of the hut and walked for a while along the path through the rainforest until we came to a clearing. A hundred or so meters ahead, meditating a few feet away from a precipice, was Hexa. 
‘Go’, Teyvanai said to Štar who, still clasping my hand, led me towards him. ‘What about Di?’ I asked puzzled. ‘We play with the little one. You go now’, Teyvanai said, her voice giving me little cause to worry. When Štar and I reached close enough to the precipice, my clumsy footsteps breaking countless twigs in the process, we found Hexa with his eyes opened and alert. The smile from earlier had disappeared. Now there was concern. 
‘Good seeing you, old friend’, he said. 
‘Honour ours, Lord Kartikeya. Us Dom not invited to weddings.’ 
‘Not often I get married’, he quipped. ‘Is she the one?’
‘No’, said Štar. ‘Little one playing with your wives. This one is a Miragian.’  
‘Sit’, he motioned to both of us. ‘You trying?’ his question pointed to Štar. 
‘Everyday, Lord Kartikeya. There is nothing inside. I am lost in darkness when I try.’ 
He was pensive. ‘I want to help, Štar but my powers…I have little.’
This was too much. ‘Wait’, I interjected, breaking their conversation. I could see annoyance flash across Štar’s face. ‘I need to know – ‘
‘Girl’, Štar snarled. ‘This not Mirage. This not Circadia. This our way. Sit. Shut up. Listen’, her attention turned back to Kartikeya. ‘Forgive her, Lord –‘
Kartikeya waved her off. ‘What is your name, girl?’, he switched to perfect Miragian. 
‘Dragonfly’
‘Your Miragian name’, he specified. 
‘Anaka’, I said after a brief hesitation. 
‘The All-Seeing one’, he broke out into a teasing smile. The tension disappeared. ‘Do you want to know why you are here, Anaka?’
I nodded. Kartikeya looked at Štar who sighed: ‘Štar has never read Di’s eyes.’ 
Allow me to just add some context here before I describe the rest of the conversation. You are by now aware that I ran away with the Štars after a conversation with their matriarch during which she exclaimed she had read my eyes and seen a dragonfly that needed to fly away. It is rational for some of you to assume you that I had lost my senses in allowing a ranting old woman to possibly trick me. But it wasn’t so. You see my middle name, Odonata, is from Circadian mythology. I don’t wish to go into the details of the story, but it involves a warrior princess named Odonata being turned into a dragonfly by her great-great-great grandfather, the Lord of all creation. No one I was with at the time in Sikar even knew my middle name. None of my companions knew of my burgeoning desire to leave my life and see the world. But Štar somehow knew. It would be rational of me to dismiss her utterance then as coincidence, an unusual serendipity of vagueness overlapping with the circumstances of my life, a happy occasion that most soothsayers long for, but I don’t believe in coincidences. It is not because I think Štar is clairvoyant, but I do believe that she is gifted in some way that allows her to gauge the totality of every person who comes into contact with her. During my first weeks, in an effort to understand the social structures that held a Dom clan together, I observed Štar closely to understand the extent of influence and power she wielded as the clan’s matriarch. It is tremendous and I’d like to think that this power comes from her special ability to simply read a person, whether stranger or otherwise, in an instance. I would humbly venture forth this further summary of my observations during this period. The matriarchal foundations of both Dom and Miragian societies is an area of study that would give us interesting insights into some questions that are increasingly salient: Why, for instance, in an age where matriarchal foundations are generally eroding (or allowed to erode away) across the world, do some cultures fight this erosion, and others do not? Why is there an undercurrent of apparent resentment in Mirage that our society still owes theological fidelity to an embodiment of female energy? Why are some so-called liberal clergy of the three faiths so adamant in giving theological precedence to The Trinity over this primordial female energy? Why are our clergy all male, while among the Dom it is a matriarch who is the centre of their universe? 
The revelation that Štar couldn’t read Di’s eyes, therefore, was a surprise to hear. I looked at Štar. 
‘Dark there, girl’, she said. 
‘Dragonfly know how Štar found little one?’ Kartikeya asked Štar. She shook her head. 
I had heard rumours that Di was an orphan, I assumed from another Dom clan, who lost her way and found Štar. And me. 
‘Last Walk’, Štar said meaning the pilgrimage from last year. ‘In desert, far away, on dune, naked, alone…we named her Di.’  
‘She was wandering the desert all by herself?’ I asked, incredulous. 
‘Fell from the sky into sand.’ 
‘Or someone abandoned her’, I reasoned. I found myself angry at the sheer thought. 
‘Not Dom’, Štar countered. ‘She daughter of Thar, she of sand, not flesh – why I can’t read her. 
‘Or’, Kartikeya stepped in, ‘Di only see future – no memory, no past in eyes to read.’
‘No stories in future, Lord Kartikeya’, Štar protested. 
‘Not for us, old friend. Little one a different breed, next step in cycle.’
Štar was silent now. ‘I don’t understand why we are so worried’, I said, breaking the silence. ‘Di’s just a little girl.’ 
‘Understand nothing, you’, Štar replied, ‘Di no memory inside – not me, not people who shelter’, she paused. ‘Not you.’ 
‘She’s just a little girl!’ I raised my voice. I was exasperated thinking that this harmless little girl should provoke such worry. ‘She’s just a little girl’, I repeated. 
 She rose and trudged back towards his wives and Di. Kartikeya cleared his throat: ‘Why are you here?’, he switched to Miragian again. 
‘That’s no business of yours, Lord Kartikeya’, I tried hiding the arrogance in my voice but failed. He pretended to not notice my conceit. ‘Do you even know why you are here?’ I stared back, choosing to not reply. ‘Answer me, girl. Do you even know why you are here?’ 
‘Yes’
‘Why?’
‘I wanted to see the world’
‘And you choose to do that by running away from your Miragian castle?’ 
‘I don’t live in a cas –‘, I stopped myself. ‘Lord Kartikeya, I mean no disrespect but please understand I only want what is best for Di.’ 
‘There’s your answer’
‘Answer? What are you -?’
‘I asked you if you knew why you are here. You do. You are here for her. I think’, he wagged his finger, ‘your fate is Di’s and Di’s fate is yours. And I think you’ve known this longer than anyone else has.’ I let this sink in, realizing full well he was right: I had entertained, even as recently as earlier that morning, the idea there was a reason why mine and Di’s lives crossed one another’s.
‘Lord Kartikeya’, I began, my voice shaking, ‘I don’t know what it is I want to do with my own life. I don’t know what I am going to do when we reach Lake Circadia.’ I confessed then. It was the truth: What, I asked myself, are you going to do when you reach the shores of Lake Circadia? Are you going to get on that boat, cross the water and go back home, back to the past? Or are you going to take the first bus back to Circadia, back home, back to my parents, back to their idea of my future? 
‘There’s an answer for that too, Anaka’, Kartikeya’s voice was warm. 
‘Di?’
‘Di’, he nodded. ‘I still think of myself a mere mortal. For reasons I’ve never understood the cosmos has granted that I live a life of a deity, but I have learnt one thing in all these years: there is no such thing as coincidence.’ He looked me in the eye in an effort, I think, to make sure I understood what it was he was telling me, ‘Štar thinks Di will be a future matriarch. And I think you, Miragian, you will be the guardian of her fate – as Di will be the guardian of yours.’ 
‘And what is my fate?’ 
‘I don’t know, but you will. Soon.’ 
‘How do you know?’ 
‘I don’t, but I can give you something that might help’, he beckoned Valli. She handed me a small pouch. ‘Keep it.’ I opened the pouch: inside were two mushrooms. ‘One for you, one for the child. It is a powerful intoxicant, but it will clear your head – and hers. And you might stumble upon what it is that both of you must do.’ 
　　　　
The next few weeks passed without any major incidents. The landscape remained unchanging. I spent most of my time during these weeks teaching reading and writing to Di. To my delight, she proved to be a wonderful student. By the second week, she was reading a couple of pages by herself. Seeing this some of the other children sat around us and very soon I found myself in the midst of a happy accident: we had created a travelling school. Every morning our classrooms would be most raucous. Children squealed in delight as they read and comprehended a sentence for the first time in their lives. I used whatever my hands could get hold of to serve as my teaching tools: sand, little twigs, leaves, fruits; I used them all to illustrate the concepts behind my language and arithmetic lessons. Štar said little in light of these developments but I caught her watching one of my lessons with an air of, at the risk of sounding self-congratulatory, contentedness. I realized soon, however, that not everyone was thrilled with my efforts to teach the children the written tradition, much less the written tradition of Miragians; some of the parents explicitly forbade theirs from attending class. I took my indignation to Štar. 
‘Dragonfly’, she said calmly, ‘You here today, what happens when you leave?’ 
I hadn’t thought of that. ‘That is beside the point, Štar. Please. All I am doing is teaching these children to read and write. There is nothing wrong with that.’ 
‘No but understand that not our way. People not happy changing our way.’ 
She was right, but now I had an idea. The sixth and final full moon of the pilgrimage was a week away. On such nights, the clan would host their feasts, and entertainment formed a large part of those celebrations. ‘Can the children tell a story at the next full moon feast?’ I asked Štar. 
‘Children no stories to tell’
‘But my children do’, I insisted. ‘I’ll show you’
She waved her hands dismissively: ‘Do, girl. I allow children tell story next moon.’ 
I spent the next few days and nights preparing for this first act of story-telling by my class. I poured over every aspect of the performance. I created make-shift costumes, wrote and made the children memorize lines, I even erected a small stage. As the full moon appeared over the mountains, I stood on the stage and announced to the clan: ‘There is a story in everyone. There is a story in every place. In the Thiruvalankadu forest, in a tiny cottage, where we set our scene, the fairest maiden in the land, is gorging herself with food and drink. She sees a bed and, tired, lies down to rest. This, the story of Vellai, we bring to this stage tonight.’
I went behind the stage and pulled up the crude curtain. On stage left: the maiden. On stage right: a man intent on killer her. The play, a retelling of the popular fairy-tale of a beautiful princess who runs away from her envious step-mother and hides among a colony of dwarves, is one that enchanted me as a child but horrified me as a woman; but it is a universal tale and I had the children enact it: seven little boys as dwarves, an older girl playing the jealous queen, one, a stronger and bigger lad, playing both the hunter and the prince at the end, and Di playing the eternally suffering Vellai, the fairest maiden in the land. 
‘What call this story?’ Štar inquired in a whisper during the performance. 
‘A play’, I said. 
‘Play – this play right thing, girl’, Štar said, inadvertently paraphrasing the mad prince. When it ended, there was a momentary silence. I scanned the gathering to gauge the reactions. I admit there was confusion in there. Then: A clap. I heard a clap. Another followed. Štar joined in the clapping too. The children on the stage were beaming. That night I finally felt I had begun repaying the clan for their generosity to me over the last few months. 
I found myself sharing a pipe with Štar later on. She called me in towards the end of the feast. I could see she was in a contemplative mood. Her caravan was, as always, smoke-filled. 
‘Final moon here – pilgrimage is end’, she said after a long drag of the pipe. She let the smoke out, puffing it out like a chimney. I nodded. She handed me the pipe. ‘What you do, do you know?’ 
I hadn’t. ‘Yes’, I lied.   
‘I not – ‘, she began and then cut herself off. I looked in her direction. She was quite clearly intoxicated and had lost her train of thought. ‘I not tell what to do, girl.’
‘No, but if you could tell me anything what would you tell me?’ 
‘I tell that our ways coming to end. Change coming, girl. It scatter us like sand in desert. I tell I fear for Dom. Garden with too many fences, more fences every Walk I see, all one goal: keep Dom out. Clan disperse one day. Our name die. I tell I think Dom will beg on streets of Mirage and Circadia – if not killed before. I tell I think our memories slowly die, too hungry and thirsty to remember our way. I tell this will happen.’
‘You’ve always told me there are no stories in the future’.  
‘Our ancestors, yes, because world was unchanging but eyes see the world changing: forests not thick, easy to walk, waters taste bad in rivers, more towns now, before there were none. You not see, girl? Miragian ancestors right. We wrong. That mistake, we will pay.’
I had no response to this sudden outburst.    
‘Lord Kartikeya right’, Štar continued. ‘New step in cycle begun. Di first sign.’
‘Štar, I do think you are over-reacting about –‘
‘- very fond of you, girl. Happy that you with us. I miss when you leave us but I not listen to Dragonfly choose parts of our life you like, and parts you think we have to throw away. You understand?’
This was a stunning riposte – a touching opening note, a stinging accusation at the end – and I was left speechless. 
‘Go. Sleep, girl. We talk tomorrow.’ 
I went back to the tent, still stinging from Štar’s, on hindsight, justified admonishing. Di was up, still in her Vellai costume, and reading off my OVI. 
‘I can’t sleep, Dragonfly’, she said slowly in Miragian with little trace of an accent. She really was an excellent student. ‘I want more stories to tell others.’ 
Her face was enough to relieve the tension in me. ‘I can’t sleep either’, I said. ‘But I have an idea.’ A few minutes later, Di and I were making our way from the campsite up a hill. The moon was at its zenith and bright ivory glow enveloped us. We sat down by a rock. 
‘Pretty’, Di said while craning her head and pointing above. 
‘It is. Right now, Di, there are men up there, on the moon’. 
She laughed. ‘Lies!’ 
‘No, there are people on the moon as we speak right now.’ 
‘How you know?’ 
‘Because I have a friend who’s always wanted to live on the moon – and he told me so’
‘Does he live on the moon?’
‘I don’t know’
‘Why not?’ 
‘Because I’ve been here answering your questions, child’, I pinched her cheeks playfully. 
‘Why can’t I see?’ she asked, her attention still on the moon.  
‘Because the moon is so far away. But some day there will be cities on the moon.’ 
‘When?’ 
‘In the future’
‘But there are no stories in the future, Dragonfly. Štar always says.’ 
‘Di’, I began, wanting to change the subject. ‘Can I ask you a question?’
‘Yes’
‘Do you remember your mother and your father?’
She shook her head. I was afraid that my question would be an emotional trigger, but I needn’t have feared. She shook her head: no malice, no pained last memories that orphans carry of the parents who abandoned them. 
‘Do you remember anything at all? Before Štar found you in the desert?’
Again, she shook her head. 
I decided to take a different approach. ‘When you sleep, do you dream, Di?’
Di, now bored, was shaking her head nonstop. ‘What do you see when you close your eyes?’ 
Her head stopped shaking. She thought briefly: ‘Dark, have no light.’
I thought about Kartikeya’s words to me.  I reached out to the pouch. I took a mushroom out and broke it into three pieces. 
At this point it is salient for me to delve into some context. As an anthropology student I had already been exposed to the nascent field of ethnomycology, the study of the importance of fungi in different cultures, and was aware of its intoxicating effects: the Circadian banker and amateur mycologist Wasson and his wife posited that that mushrooms had played a pivotal role in the religious lives of early civilizations across the Pangea continent. The Wassons’ seminal paper included accounts from tribal leaders, medicine men, and shamans who professed the fungi’s magical qualities to heal the sick (the writers note here that the ingenious populations make no distinction between mental and physical illnesses – just as their ways of life didn’t distinguish between religion and medicine), and to mediate in matters between men and God. 
I had already decided that I’d ingest a mushroom towards the end of the journey in an effort to gain some perspective on what it is I wanted to do with my life – and since sober reflection hadn’t helped in this regard, I reasoned intoxication might provide the necessary spark. But here, this joyous curiosity made flesh and bone, was a greater mystery I wanted to solve. 
‘Di’, I said. ‘I am going to give you something to eat. It may feel strange, but I want you to know that there is nothing to be afraid of. Okay?’ She nodded. ‘Good’, I said. ‘Remember I am right here.’ 
She bit the piece I gave her while I chewed on mine. I had a fair idea of what to expect: among the Wasson couple’s priceless contributions to their field of inquiry was an account of their subjective experiences when they themselves tried the sacred mushrooms for the first time. 
I expected the effects to take a while to manifest, but in that I was wrong. In front of the rock we sat on was a lonely orchid and as I observed its perfect form, its gaze, until then cast downwards towards the grass, changed; it now seemed to observed me. I thought of my grandfather and his obsession to see the Ghost Orchid. 
‘What’s happening, Dragonfly? I can see more colours now.’
My hands embraced her. ‘There’s nothing to worry, Di. I am right here. Look’, I pointed, ‘Isn’t that the prettiest orchid?’ 
‘It looks like a bee’ – She was right: it looked like a bee’s behind – ‘the mouth is getting bigger, Dragonfly! I feel like I am falling into its mouth!’ 
Instinctively I went for her hands, ‘Hold on, Di. It’ll get better. I promise.’ I lied. I realized I was on the brink of nausea myself and holding Di’s hands were as much for my benefit as for hers. It was then Di vomited, spraying the projectiles towards the errant orchid that had threatened to gulp her whole. My nausea too got worse and I had to use every iota of energy to get my mind to stop thinking of its onset. I failed. Soon we were both on our hunches puking away our dinner, the rancid taste of curry and bile bubbling from within our stomachs. When it was done, I lay weak on the grass and noticed Di regained her orientation before I had. She brought me my can of water. 
‘Feeling better?’ she asked, her tone almost adult-like in its assuredness. On hindsight, this was the moment I knew Kartikeya was right: Di and I were meant to be each other’s guardians. 
‘Weak, but I am alright. How does it feel now?’ 
‘I can see far, Dragonfly’
‘How far?’ 
‘As far as the end’
‘What end?’ I turned towards the horizon. 
‘The end’
I turned back. It was still dark. I could see the valley and, if my eyes strained hard enough, the reflection of the moonlight on Lake Circadia’s waters. ‘Where is the end?’ I asked. 
‘Inside, Dragonfly’
I tried standing, I was still weak, but now I was close to my goal in giving her the mushrooms in the first place: ‘Tell me what you see.’ 
For those readers who have at any pointed ingested these ‘magic mushrooms’ that are found in almost every corner of our planet, the physiological effects that I have described above would no doubt sound familiar. To those who haven’t and are wondering why I would subject myself and a child to these effects, I owe some explanation. 
The Wassons, the first non-indigenous people to ever ingest and describe in detail the effects of these mushrooms, spent only a line or two describing the physiological effects; they were warned, I believe by the shaman who had accompanied them, to expect nausea prior to feelings of ‘oneness.’ The word always struck me as odd and out of place in the midst of the dry prose; it seemed vague, a result of their inability to translate the native vernacular of their shaman. But at that moment, the aftertaste of vomit still lingering on my tongue, I understood what this ‘oneness’ meant. Allow me then a further digression so that I can explain my own subjective perception of the onset of the mushroom’s effects; I hope when I return to Di’s revelations – a heavy word to assign to a child’s intoxicated ranting, I realize, but humour me this one time, dear reader; I have my reasons – you will have a better understanding of what was possibly going on inside her mind. 
When I vomited, I became acutely aware of a sudden increase in total awareness. Imagine the totality of information our senses collect as a raging river. Now imagine there is a dam that impounds this body of information; that dam is our brain. It controls the strong surge of our senses and makes it do useful things: that that the aroma you smell is of bread being baked, that colour is red, that sound is of a man singing, that the material of our dress is cotton, it allows us to perceive time, and so on. What happens when this dam cracks or can no longer control this surge of sensory information? 
I believe that is what happened to us on the hilltop. For me, the experience of the ‘oneness’ was a brief moment: everything around me – the hills, the sky, the moon, the grass, the trees, Di – disintegrated into atoms. This apparition disappeared very quickly to be replaced by a surge of vignettes from the past. Every significant, and sometimes seemingly not so, memory in my life sped by at a terrific rate inside my mind’s eye. I was reeling when Di offered me water. 
‘The end is coming closer, Dragonfly’ I saw panic in her eyes. 
‘Look at me, Di’, I said holding her cheeks, my eyes boring into hers. ‘What do you see?’
‘A demon. He’s coming for us’
‘Look around, there are no demons’, I tried comforting her. 
‘Not now, Dragonfly’ - again the adult-tone in her retort - ‘but soon. We must tell the others’
‘We will’, I reassured her. ‘For now, can we sit and talk?’ She nodded. 
‘Good girl’, I smiled.
We lay down on the rock again and I decided to shift the subject. I pointed at the few stars that could be seen and taught their names to her. This went on for a while before Di interrupted: ‘Dragonfly, are you leaving when we get to the Lake?’ 
‘Who told you that?’ 
‘Everyone’, she paused: ‘Štar.’ 
‘Well, she is wrong.’
‘You are staying?’ the child’s voice was returning.  
I sighed. ‘I don’t know, Di. What would you like me to do?’ 
‘I want you to be happy always.’
‘I am happy.’
‘Not the last few days.’ 
The child was perceptive, sometimes to a fault, but her words reminded me of something a close friend once said to me. 
‘If I leave, if I go back to Mirage, will you like to come with me?’ 
Di hesitated. ‘Will you be happy in Mirage?’ 
‘I don’t know, child’, I was exasperated, ‘I don’t know anything anymore.’ 
‘You will’, she kissed me on the cheek. ‘You are Dragonfly.’ 
We feel asleep that night, Di on my chest, on the hilltop. When we woke up the next morning, and the sun rose behind us, I could see Lake Circadia more clearly, the glare from the rays of the sun giving the mythical lake an ethereal quality. I could no longer postpone my decision. 
‘Di’, I turned to her, ‘I’ll leave you at the camp. Tell Štar I’ll meet her at the shores of the lake.’
‘Are you going back to Mirage?’ 
I still didn’t know the answer to that question. ‘I have something to do’, I said, ‘but if I leave I leave with you.’ 
　　　　
The road leading to Lake Circadia was a two hour walk. It gave enough time for me to ponder on what it is I wanted to do with my life. The mushroom had let my memories assault me – and I stood up to it, defiant that it wouldn’t hold me back – but I was too concerned with Di to bother about myself. I wanted to experience the effects of the mushroom alone and within sight of Miragian shores. 
Lake Circadia lies a mile behind the Circadian fishing town of Kollam. It was early, but the fisherfolk were up and viewed me with great amusement. I overheard failed whispers: ‘Is that a Dom bitch? I fucking hate Doms’, ‘No’, another replied, ‘her skin’s too fair for a Dom, but she wears their shit, that’s for sure. I mean look at those fucking colours.’ 
I paid no heed except quickening my pace. The town was small and before long I was out and came upon a sign that read, ‘LAKE CIRCADIA, 500 Yards Ahead’. I stopped and dug into my bag: the last mushroom. Please I remember telling myself please help me decide. I chewed on it as the path led me through a thick bush and I was already under the influence of the fungi when I emerged on the other side, on the Circadian shores of the lake. 
It isn’t the aim of this memoir to spend too much time on myself and the issues I was grappling with; indeed I’ve already wasted too many words musing about my psyche at the time. But I did so because I felt it was necessary to contextualize my motivations: why did I do what I did - from running away in the first place to meeting Di, from my experiences in being at the receiving end of the almost infinite generosity of the Dom people to my complicated relationship with Štar during those first six months - to that moment when I gazed upon the other side, the Miragian shores of Lake Circadia, while intoxicated in the bewitching stew of hope and fear that the mushrooms invoked with indescribable ease; all of this to say I made my decision that day. 
During those few lonely hours by myself on the shores I endured many curious stares from passers-by – Circadians alighting from ferries bound to Mirage, Miragians stepping forth on Circadian shores, street-hawkers, shop owners – who thought I was ‘a Dom lunatic who lost her way’ (a statement, if you choose to look at pedantically, removing its seemingly political incorrectness, was correct). I admired the grace of the sashaying palm trees in the Miragian coast and wondered what it was that convinced a fraction of the Dom three millennia ago to cross the lake looking for a home. It is an area of study that historians have struggled to explain because the image that the evidence paints so far is politically polarizing: Miragian history tells us the original founders were the supposed Desert People, a nomadic nation of three tribes; Dom folklore suggests that Mirage was born when large numbers of their people decided that they had had enough of the nomadic way of life.  
I offer an alternative theory. History teaches us that nothing happens in vacuum. The flashpoints, the landmarks in time, are mere culminations of processes that had long before begun. Wars, for instance, don’t erupt out of the blue – they are the logical next step in a festering environment of distrust. Could the fraction of Dom who splintered have been under the influence of a charismatic leader (or leaders) who were themselves in conflict with another faction inside the ever-moving Domian nation? Could seeing the shores of Mirage, then, convinced the former to take a leap of faith and go into the unknown? If so, what could have possibly given them the mental fortitude and the sheer vision needed to found a nation? I posit that this source of strength could have come from ingesting mushrooms. 
Imagine this conflict brewing between a majority and a minority, between ideas and ideals, between the past and the future. Imagine this minority did indeed have charismatic leaders who were allied by a need to settle down. Imagine that they’d somehow acquire these mushrooms during their journey to the Circadian coastline, ingested it and saw the Mirage’s coast across the lake. Perhaps they didn’t see it as merely another little island unworthy of exploration like the rest of the Dom had for centuries until then. Perhaps they saw a home. And when they got to Mirage and began their millennia journey to create a nation state, it was necessary at some point to write a genesis of the founding of our nation. Perhaps this genesis would be written in ornate prose and deliberately vague on details (record-keeping, indeed writing of any sort, was a skill traditionally possessed only by high officials during this time). Perhaps that is how the Book of Mirage came to be. 
I realize my speculations will come across as blasphemous - the fact that I obviously have no evidence to back my theory makes it come across even more clumsily than I hope to - but let me state for the record: blasphemy holds little interest to me despite my lack of religious convictions. I merely present my idea for the consideration of readers who have the necessary academic background needed to refute it. But if my hunch is right, it could help in reconciling Miragian history and Domian folklore, and help us have a richer, more holistic view of our place in time. And that, I believe, is a task worthy of striving for.   
The sun had passed the zenith and was on its descent to the western sky when I felt her hands embracing me from behind. 
‘You didn’t leave, Dragonfly!’
‘I told you I’d wait for you, didn’t I?’ I held her hands. ‘Where are the rest?’ 
‘Setting up camp. Štar is looking for you too’
I got up. ‘Come on then. I need to talk to her.’ 
‘Have you decided?’ 
‘Yes.’
I found Štar seated in her caravan, door open, and issuing instructions to the men of the tribe. When she saw the two of us walking towards the camp our eyes met briefly and she smiled. She knew. 
‘It is done’, she said. ‘You decided.’ 
‘I need to say goodbye to a few people’, my voice was stoic.
‘How will you do that?’
‘I saw an OVI booth in town. I’ll be back.’
‘What OV – never mind. Do what you must’, She grabbed my hand as I started to walk, ‘You happy here, among us?’  
‘I am, Štar’, I tried smiling but the weight of what I needed to do was dragging me down. 
Di and I made our way to town where I quickly located the OVI booth I had seen while passing through earlier in the day. It was still open. As we stepped in, a gruff voice cut across the row of OVI screens: ‘What are you doing, Domi?’
The caretaker was a fat man with an unpleasant face. 
‘I need to use the OVI –‘
The fat man laughed. ‘Listen to this shit!’ He said aloud to no one in particular, ‘Fucking Domi wants to get online on OVI now. What is the world coming to eh?’
‘Listen, there’s no need for that language. I have a child with me’, I said, straining to keep my temper in check. ‘All I want is to get online on OVI for a few minutes. That’s it.’
He stood and walked towards us. ‘Well you can’t!’ he was eyeing me. ‘They are all taken’. 
I looked around. ‘There’s not a single person inside except the three of us’, I replied. 
‘You have any idea how expensive these devices are?’, he said, changing the subject. ‘I am not going to let you savages –‘
‘I don’t need your screen. I already have mine with me’, I took my tablet out. ‘See?’ 
His eyes popped. ‘Which poor bastard did you steal that from eh? You can’t possibly know how to use that.’
I was getting tired of this. ‘Listen to me, all I need is to get online. Can I login to your network and get online. Yes or no?’ 
‘I am not answering any questions until I see some money.’ 
‘How much?’ 
’30 Rūpya for 15 minutes.’
I dug into my bag again. ‘Here’, I showed him the Fifty Rūpya, ‘I have fifty. Happy?’ 
He tried grabbing the note; I pulled it back before his greasy hands could snatch it. ‘Login credentials first. Then I pay you.’ 
He stepped back, walked towards his counter and came back with a card. ‘Swipe this’, he said this, ‘You have 30 minutes. Then I want you filthy savages to fuck off’. 
I swiped the card and my OVI sprung to life. All manner of messages, news alerts, missed call notifications popped up on the screen. Di, who by this point, was used to the device’s offline utility value hadn’t seen this magic. Her eyes widened in amazement.
‘What is this, Dragonfly?’ 
‘I’ll explain later’, I said, distracted by having to clear the endless notifications that flooded my now connected OVI. When all was done I selected the dialler and called my mother. 
‘Ana. Dear Mirage! I was worried sick! Where are you?’
‘Hey, mama’, her familiar voice of concern made me laugh in response.
‘That’s right. Laugh! Stupid child. Where are you?’
‘I am near Lake Circadia on the Circadian shores’
‘So it is done then, this pilgrimage?’ 
‘Well the walk in the garden finishes today –‘
‘But?’
‘But I am not coming back just yet.’
She sighed. ‘This is not going to help relations between your father and you’
Now it was my turn to sigh, ‘Mama, I am not doing this to anger Papa, or make grandpa proud. I am not doing this to make you worry about me. I am doing this because I want to be happy. Please try and understand.’
‘Are you happy now?’
‘Switch on video, mama. I want to show you something’, I pulled Di closer to me. 
Mama’s face appeared. I held the OVI at an arm’s distance so she could get a full view of Di and me. I could see she was fighting tears, but seeing an unfamiliar face next to me made her pause. 
‘This, mama, is Di. She’s the light and joy of my life’, I turned to Di, ‘Say hello Di. That is my mother.’
‘Hello’, Di said, completely at a loss to explain how it was my mother and I were miles apart but could still talk to each other, face to face. 
‘Hello’, the sadness left my mother’s face. ‘Who is this then, Ana?’ 
‘Who is Ana, Dragonfly?’
‘They call you ‘Dragonfly’ eh?’
‘Grandpa would find it hilarious’, I said and quickly turned to Di: ‘That’s my Miragian name. Ana. Well, Anaka.’ 
‘I like Dragonfly better.’ 
‘You can call me Dragonfly, little one’, I turned back to mama: ‘So I am teaching this little ball of mischief and her friends, mama’, I paused, ‘I’ve never felt happier.’ 
‘Are they treating you well?’
‘You don’t need to worry, mama. They treat me like their own’, I replied. ‘How is papa?’
‘Close to retiring’
‘Give him my love’
‘He won’t show it, but he’ll be delighted that you are happy’
‘I am. Very happy, mama.’
The rest of the call was divided between the usual mother-daughter catching-up and her delight at Di. 
When it was time to end, her disposition changed again: ‘You’ll come back someday, right?’ 
‘I don’t know, mama. Let me do this. I promise I’ll take care of myself. And I will keep in touch as much as possible.’ 
She was silent for a moment. ‘Has he been writing to you?’ 
‘I haven’t checked.’
‘Well, he’s in Circadia now finishing his doctoral studies. And there are rumours flying around the Diplomatic community.’
‘What rumours?’ 
‘There’s a rumour going around that Circadia is to gift Mirage a lunar temple. And that President Mahasen’s youngest son will be its first head scientist-priest.’
