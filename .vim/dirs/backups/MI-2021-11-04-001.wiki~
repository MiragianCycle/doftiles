== Possible Candidate for Forking into *Oh-Vi-Write*

- This project here [https://github.com/VapourNvim/VapourNvim] might be a good candidate for forking into what will become *Oh-Vi-Write*:
    - Reasons:
        - It's easy to read: the .lua config files are fairly human readable
        - It has a fairly easy system for user-configurability as well
        - It's built with speed in mind
                TODO: 
               -  Some ideas for first Lua plugins in order of complexity:

                            - [] Character-builder
                            - [] Anagram Name Generator
                            - [] World-builder 
                            - [] Git Wrapper for Writers
