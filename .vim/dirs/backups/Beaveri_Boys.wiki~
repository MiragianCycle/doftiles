== Sample Lines == 

'Machan, I am going to die a virgin.'

I looked up from the math problem that had confused me for the last two weeks. 

'We are all going to die virgins', Thilan continued. 'Did you notice none of them even looked or said hello to us?'

'Who, the girls?'

'Yeah!  It's been almost a month since we got integrated. I mean they didn't even  talk to Azaad. If he doesn't get a second look, what chance do the rest of us have? We are fucked.' He paused. 'Well that's not true. No girl is ever going to fuck me. No girl is ever going to fuck you. No girl is even going to fuck Azaad - and he's the pretty one! 

'Okay, we have our mid-term test coming up, can we --?'

'Adey, mara bugger you are! I am scared I am going to die a virgin. I am scared all my boys are also going to die virgins. And do you know why?'

'No why?'

'It's this fucking uniform', he pointed at the school crest on the left breast pocket of our light blue shirts. He was right; combined with dark blue trousers we did look slightly ridiculous even by the standards of Sri Lankan school uniforms. 'We look like security guards! All the girls must think we are security guards.'

'You realize they wear the same uniforms', I reminded him.

'Yeah but they look good. The look like women in the air force. All of them. Especially Shaila.'

The mention of the name made something within me jump - in excitement or fear, I couldn't tell. 

Thilan saw the change in my face. 'Okay, okay, you went after her first, she's yours.'

'Mine? I don't think she even knows I exist.'

'Yes, but you are both Tamil. And from Jaffna also! The only Jaffna Tamil boy in our batch is you, the only Jaffna Tamil girl in our batch is her - it's a match made in heaven! Only a matter of time before she comes around, tells her parents, and before you know it you two will have kids and a family and ...'

'Thilan, we turned 17 a couple of months back. Don't you think..'

'Is studying all you can think of, you bugger?'

'Oi. We barely passed the O-Levels - we are on thin ice. Also...is falling in love, fucking, getting married and having kids all you can think of?', I countered.

'How can you not? This is not new, I am not doing anything that's never been done before. Thousands of men over history have been sad and wondered if they'd win the love of their life or die miserable. You do poetry and literature - how do you not know this?'

'Thousands of men have also wondered if they'd solve the math problem in front of them.'

'You are useless. I am going to the basketball court. Want to come?'

'I wouldn't mind a game after school. Too risky now with Sam on his usual walk around the compound.'

'Oh for fuck's sake, bugger. I don't want to play. I just want to go away from here and hangout in the carpenters shed and listen to the Walkman in peace, so I don't have this', he pointed at the open books in front of him, 'to look at.'

'You go. I'll see you after school. Sure you don't want to play some One Bump before we go home? You only need to bat - I need some catching prac..'

'You are the reason we are going to die virgins', he stood up.

'Don't get caught to Sam. I can't be calling and explaining to your father again!', he was out before I could finish the sentence.

===Feedback from First Chapter Swap===
- [ ] so there are lots of spatial descriptions, which i don't think add much to your text necessarily - the strength is the dialogue i feel
- [ ] not expecting multiple 'narrators' so to speak - that was a nice surprise and i think it works\
- [ ] the checkpoint scene was strong, but i would go so far as to adopt your multilingual stance and write the sinhala in sinhala as heard by someone who doesn't speak sinhala
- [ ] pg 13 the segregation of schools line - doesn't feel authentic. i think you can play around with the idea and say it in other words - in a 17 year old boy sense. it's too heavy handed as is.
- [ ] pg 18 - i think the smell of the news was the most potent line for me in the whole chapter; i immediately smelled newspaper ink; so in the preceding paragraph, instead of whispers/rumours, i would play around with the smell metaphor. a great and or mysterious stink that hangs over the country basically
- [ ] would not use the word monolingual.
- [ ] liked the history of the country through the school building
- [ ] p24 2nd paragraph i think you need to cut. a case of show don't tell in this instance.
- [ ] sam's states of matter speech was 100%
- [ ] there is scope to write more to timestamp the what we're reading more powerfully than just say it's happening in 1998/ tracy + music. ke both in the vernacular of how the people sound but also some little nuggets to give it more contextual grit.
- [ ] i think there's something about the temporality and the multiple narrators that needs finetuning but i don't think that's a now issue but a later revision issue
         - [ ]  you had a temporal positioning for your narrators in mind - (as in: are they reflecting back from now the present as adults or are we reading this as it happens when you don't have hindsight) that needs to made clearer/more consistent
         - [ ] because if it's the latter, the nostalgia/more grown up analysis immediately feels off
         - [ ] u may want to give the latter a go because i think it will make the writing better - how would a teenage boy or girl or an uncle describe the state of the world without it being 'analysis' or just adult perspective - this is also where there's real success in sam's 'states of matter' speech
         - [ ] there also then needs to be some indication to the reader of which it is. this is where the multiple narrators can also get messy i feel but i don't think it's impossible to work around.
