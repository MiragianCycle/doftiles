== Pitch for Reza and Distributors == 

*Pitch 1*: Z Lanka 
Alternative Title: Pogromming 


1. The story will situate itself in 1983
2. We have two approaches: a Bombay but with Zombies approach or a Magnolia with Zombies approach
3. The Bombay with Zombies: Tamil couple, different castes, are on the verge of eloping when the anti-Tamil pogrom of July 1983 begins. Fearing for their lives from both their families and a society on the verge of breaking down, the couple run into a jungle where, unbeknownst to them, a mysterious new illness is making its way through society.  
4. The Magnolia But with Zombies: In this, we will examine 1983 through the eyes of many Sri Lankans, but instead of showing 83 as an overt thing, we draw parallels between a zombie epidemic and the epidemic of losing one's humanity.  
5. Ran the idea by Vindhya who mentioned that the zombie trope has local folklore precedents which include the idea of the dead rising and reanimated corpses.

- 'the practice is called pillu: you have to find a corpse that's less than 3 days old and go to the grave at midnight and dig up the body. the kattadiya lies down in the grave and starts reciting. firstly, various devils will come so you have to appease them with treats (sacrifices?). these take various forms. so first a snake who needs to be fed eggs, then a wildboar who needs to be fed yams, a dog that needs to be fed a chicken, an elephant that needs to be fed sugarcane. once you complete that the corpse is reanimated and will sit up and their tongue will roll out right up to the stomach. the tongue will then be cut off and that can also be used for ritual purposes or 'pilli'. for example, tongue fed to a dog can be set to attack a specific person. the reanimated corpse can be dispatched to kill/injure someone or steal something within a three hour window after which they can be chucked back in the grave and reburied.'
- The above is a good seague into my own idea:
    - We set the story in 1983 where we pretend Black July didn't happen
    - Instead, we take the focus into 'Black Magic Practicing Politician' who needs a distration to ensure political victory.
    - He hatches a plan that gets witch doctors to reanimate fresh corpses to go killing people from different sides of the ethnic divide.
    - Even if the above makes no sense, remember to make the allegorical parallel between the mindless bloodlust of zombies and people who stroke ethnic fires
    - Right now the plot is two Tamils, a couple from mixed castes, running away to the jungle where they happen upon an ancient practice: the freshly animated corpse kills the boy, leaving a terrified girl to run deep into the jungle in fear.
    - She vows revenge
