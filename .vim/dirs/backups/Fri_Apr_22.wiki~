= Plain Tea or Milk Tea =

Do you smell the slavery, 
When you sip on this cup of tea?
Injustice plucked from one land,
Displaced in another, 
Treated like dirt? 
Well dirt is where this necatar
Germinated a century hence and 
Whitewashed with milk, 
So the black is turned tan, 
Like our conscience 
When we sip a cup of Pure Ceylon Tea.


I smell slavery when I sip on this cup of tea, 
Yet I can't stop myself - the brew is intoxicating, 


Do you smell the slavery when you sip on this cup of pure Ceylon Tea?
