===Secret Editing Hacks===  

:SecretEditingHacks: 

 This is Sven's secret editing hacks under the following categories:

    ===*_SELECTION_*===
     
      - Very crucial part of editing
      - Selecting is the process of identifying, organizing and accessing the best moments in the footage  
      - All professional editors have their own selection methods
      - 75% of great editing is selection
      - It is the most important part
      - Roger Niggard: "Good editing is primarily about choosing the right takes"
      - Different editors with the same footage arrive at different outcomes
      - Great editors need to hit 80% or better success rarte in picking the best takes 
      
         ===*_THE PROCESS_*===
        
          - Start by creating a select bin
          - In that bin, create a new timeline named after the footage title
          - Start the sequence with 3 Video Layers, and 8 Audio Layers (in mono) 
          - Each of the 3 Video Layers, corresponds to the Internal Criteria that you've set for yourself (i.e. *Okay Moments*, *Good Moments*, *Gold Moments* )
          - Select the specific take/scene that you are working on, and place your selection based on where you *feel* the moment belongs to
          - You are making thousands of editorial decisions at every moment - use good judgement. The best cut is the one that is emotionally and tonally justifiable to the story that you are trying to tell 
          - In general, *Gold Moments* is visually stunning, pushes the story forward, or reveals something about a character 
          - Moving to another take from the same scene is fine - give it a space in the timeline, and then continue as you did above for the earlier take
          - Evaluaue each beat, each moment on its own, take note of your feelings  
          - This system has a visual record of your emotional reaction to seeing a clip for the first time 
          - This is now an easy reference if you need to recut the scene from scratch 
          - Upon finishing the select reel, you will need to create a new timeline (use the scene-take logic of your footage in naming these sequences so that they are easy to find)
          - Use *Pancake Editing* when editing the select reel into your first cut for a scene - i.e. have both selection and cut timelines on top of one another so that you can visually copy and paste from the *Selection Timeline* > *Cut Timeline*
          - At this point, *Continuity* isn't a priority - _emotion is_ - remember what [[Cinema|Cinema]] Murch said about the practical side of choosing the Six Rules of Editing - if you are going to discard a scene for whatever reason, let the first reason be continuity.
          
          
    ===*_KEY FACTORS*_===
     
    - Watch every frame - don't skim
    - Watch in real time
    - Take note of how the footage makes you feel - how you feel is how the audience might feel
    - You are the audience's ambassador
    - Mark footage with the following *Okay Moments*, *Good Moments*, and *Gold Moments* 
    - Cut from the *Gold Moments* as a first step when you are ready to assemble
    - By starting with the *Gold Moments* you have a better chance at getting a very effective first cut, and it is efficient 
    - Putting two shots together, you create meaning; when you attach two *Gold Moments* together, the audience - usually smarter than you give them credit for - will have created meaning for the combination of those two shots together
    - This also ensures that the audience is engaged from the opening shot  
    
    ===*_FOUR STEP PROCESS_*===
    
      - Create Select Timelines
      - Watch the dailies
      - Okay, Good, Gold
      - Assemble the gold 

    ===*_DOCUMENTARY_*===
     
      - The above case works for feature films but also for Documentaries 
        - In this case, you'd also do selection reels
        - In documentaries, the Okay, Good, Gold will include B-Roll and Interviews
