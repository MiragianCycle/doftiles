1. What is a second brain? Why do I need one?
   - Modern life is an information overload
   - We have to recognize though that we are living in the greatest information era in human history? It behoves us to feed our curiosities with new information.  
   - This is easier said than done: How do you ensure that some new piece of information that you learnt is retained, retrieveable, and useful to either your work or approach to your life, whether socially or professioally?   
   - Personally, I am a novelist, engaged in building a ficitional world. How can I engage in world-building when I don't know anything about the world. I owe it to my writing, and my readers. 
2. Approaches 
   I. Analogue
   II. Digital
3. How I used to do
   I. Drawbacks - Pencil and paper 
   II. Drawbacks - Browser based, thus open to distraction
   III. Drawbacks - Word processors are terrible for note-taking 
4. What I needed 
    - Inter-connected files
    - One 'app'
    - Fast as fuck
    - Not anchored to a paid service or software 
6. Zettlekasten

   - [ ] Why it works
