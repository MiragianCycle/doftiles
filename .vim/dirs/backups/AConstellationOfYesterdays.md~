                        **A Constellation of Yesterdays**

              *In light against inky canvas, countless yester-worlds*
                               *Constellate in lieu of memory;*
                        *Against this white night, I constellate*
                                 *In lieu of you*
                                 
                                           

<I was born last night> 

<It is 12 hours, 34 minutes, 23 seconds since I came into this world, but I already have stories to tell and memories to share>

<In the beginning, there were fireflies> 

‘Fireflies?’ 

Ten thousand fireflies showed me my fate lies on the moon.

‘You’re too young to know what fate is.’ 

We are all insects, father. The fate of fireflies is to eat. Ours is to dream. 

His father sighed, ‘Your fate will be your brothers’, your brothers’ fate will be yours, your fate will be the same as mine, and your grandfather’s: Our fate is in the hands of the people of Mirage. Our fate – your fate, Dev – will be in those ballot boxes - not on the moon. Do you understand? Happy birthday. Go to sleep. Good night.’ 

                                              ===

Nothing fucks the minds of children quite like poverty. 

Yara Mahasen had understood from a young age that he had to choose between a life of servitude and survival - or find and start climbing the invisible ladder every society has. He had no interest in servitude so Yara chose survival while looking for the ladder. 

One afternoon, as his fellow clerks gulped the thin gruel that was served during lunch every day of their working lives, he found it. Yara asked the other clerks if they thought this, pushing the bowl aside, was reasonable. The men stopped talking. A minute earlier their conversations had concerned their children, and the rising costs of feeding and educating them but now Yara asked the question that floated in their minds. 

‘This’s the way it has always been, Yara. You only here a few months’, a middle-aged man with missing teeth said. ‘This is our fate.’ 

‘Then our fate is no better than that of insects living in fear of some asshole trampling out their existence. Are you all insects?’, the question punched them. He let it sink into their heads. ‘Even insects eat better that this shit they give us!’ 

The table was silent. ‘What are you saying?’

‘I am saying we don’t leave our fate in the hands of others. I am saying we demand a rise in wages. Better food!’, he raised the note at the end. ‘I am saying we protest until the demands are met.’ 

There were polite giggles at first, but transformed into a finger-pointing-laughing fit that erupted when the man with missing teeth announced to the hall Yara Mahasen’s plan. ‘Insects have to work for bosses too, silly bastard!’, someone shouted as Yara stormed out. 

That night, still panting from making love to his teenage wife Ella, ‘I’m going on a hunger strike tomorrow. Going to demand better wages starting tomorrow.’ 

No amount of pleading from Ella could change his mind. The next morning Yara set off early to the Town Council dressed in earthy red instead of the uniform brown khaki his work obligated him to wear. He sat at the foot of the stairs, laid out his banner, and began a fast that lasted a fortnight. 

The other clerks were taken aback but agreed the young man was brave; stupid, but brave. ‘Coming to his senses soon enough, young bloods always do’, they told themselves. As hours turned to days, they stepped out of their dusty offices to see if the mad Yara had finally given into hunger. He hadn’t. Ella had now joined him too. Husband and young wife sat at the foot of the stairs leading to the Council Building. Young, impressionable clerks soon joined them. Some were accompanied by their wives. The older ones shook their head, refusing to participate.    

Ten days passed with little incident. The Councilmen and Administrators, until then ignoring the protests, finally began to notice their absence from work: The system was failing. What took an hour’s paper work stretched into days, and what took days was lost in a limbo of creaky cupboards and rusty file cabinets. 

They came to Yara with promises and then thinly-veiled threats but Yara wouldn’t move until they signed a new wage increase and passed it publicly at the next meeting of the Town Council.  His patience exhausted, the Mayor responded by ordering the police to arrest the protestors for public nuisance and to force-feed them lest they continue their fast in jail. 

The crowd of protestors scattered as soon as they saw the police moving in, running with what little energy their bodies had left but Yara and Ella sat motionless like a pair of meditating statues. Whips and blows rained down upon them. The more Yara and Ella refused to fight back the angrier the police became.  

The clerks watched from their offices as the officers dragged Ella by her hair, along the rocky path where tiny stones pressed against her exposed hips and ankles, scraping, and biting into her skin. 

The unconscious bodies were then cruelly tossed into the back of their jeeps and driven off. Yara and Ella were sent to prison. No charges were pressed against them. The newspapers the next morning made no mention of this event. 

Yara was put in solitary confinement for the first month. Every day he groped to the corner of the dark room and prepared for the terrifying arrival of light: the harsh rays of torches pointed at his face, the aggressive steps of men rushing towards him, grabbing his limbs, pinning him against the wall, and inserting a tube through his nose that snaked its way to his throat and into him stomach. One day, the snake missed and entered his lung. It was only the body’s panicked gag reflex that pushed the tube out before it excreted the gruel <the same gruel that had driven Yara to protest in the first place> into his lung. 

Ella, meanwhile, was among madams, whores, drug pushers and abusers, and women who had killed their abusive husbands; these women who had removed the mask of equality that society wore and spat on its patriarchal face, watched this pretty, bruised and limping girl walk out to the yard for the first time, and they felt the stirring of what they long assumed had died inside of them: a maternal instinct. No more could the guards force-feed Ella without facing a riot in the prison. Instead, the oldest inmates had taken it upon themselves to gently coax her into eating. When they came to learn she was pregnant a few weeks later, the younger ones created a roster of women watching over her throughout the night. Jara was a prison baby for the first six months of his life. A whole year passed before Yara would even know that his wife was alive - and that she had borne him a son.

Jara and Yara were two important members of Miragian mythology. Though twins, they were never seen together; the predominant school of thought explained this curiosity away by claiming that the former was responsible for creation and the latter for destruction – and that these two forces could never mix in the same space and time without destroying that space and that time, causing the cycle of life to begin anew. Jara had a more elegant explanation for the never-seen-together twins: they were both one person, a man whose deep slumber was the creation of the universe; and his irritated waking its destruction. <Many years later, days after his father’s funeral, Jara would find Yara’s unpublished novel, The History of Time and Time Again in which the latter would expand on this hypothesis.>

Meanwhile, outside the prison walls, the Association of State Administrative Clerks of Toliara, <The ASACT’s members would in time become the first members of a new political party, founded on promoting and enhancing workers’ rights> had formed. A unanimous condemnation of the police’s actions towards Yara and Ella was the first motion to pass. 

Trade union action, the first in modern Miragian history, was the second.  

The Town Council stopped functioning completely but refused to recognize the ASACT’s authority. Again, the police were called, but this time the protestors took a different route: they hit back at the police. The ensuing riot lasted only a few hours, but killed 40 clerks, 15 police officers, five women, and two children. It would go down in Miragian history as the Toliara Town Square Massacre. This time, the unrest made the news. Trade Unions mushroomed across the country every day, riots followed every other day. Thousands <officially 11,275> of people were killed in less than a year of chaos. Some simply disappeared without a trace. When the Miragian Army finally squashed the rebellion <official policy forbade anyone from the state machinery to call it a ‘civil war’>, the toll on the national psyche was so much it felt like every citizen – army, rebel, civilian, politician – had PTSD to last a lifetime. Only prisoners were spared; Yara, Ella, Jara and inmates across Mirage had prison walls to protect them from the collective trauma of watching a brief and vicious uprising almost burn the country down to ashes. 

A national process of truth-finding was called for. The Miragian Supreme Court passed a court order for the immediate release of Yara, Ella, and the prison baby Jara. The Executive branch relented. A year later, Yara ran for and won a seat representing his borough at the Town Council. 

Nobody at 21. 

15 months in prison. 

Councilman at 24. 

His first act as Councilman: Better meals at work. ‘Either that or there’ll be more riots in our town square. The bloodshed will once again be on those who choose to treat us like we are dirt’, he said ending his speech. It was a threat made in a sombre tone, in a room that was overflowing with clerks from across the country. They cheered everything he said, and drowned out any councillor who dared to be contrarian. 

Five years later he contested for the Presidency of the Council under his newly formed Miragian Workers Party <which, coincidentally, chose a ladder as the party symbol>. He won by a landslide, eventually serving three terms before the ladder showed itself again; then it was provincial politics and finally national politics. From an iconic figure in the struggle for workers’ rights, Jara sensed the culmination of his political and personal ambitions when he was unanimously chosen as the common opposition candidate in the Miragian Presidential elections. ’92 began in grand fashion. His son was now a senator himself, his third grandson was on his way, and the polls painted a picture in his mind of political perfection: his inevitable victory speech, flanked on either side by Ella, Jara and his pregnant wife Yami, and their sons Manal and Hasyl. But Yara knew that that would only be the beginning; that the writing of political legacy was a long and painstaking process. He would only be alive to write the first pages and then it would be Jara’s turn, and then his sons’ and their sons’ afterwards to continue writing the book until it came to a point in time when no one could imagine a life where the name Mahasen was not uttered by every Miragian.  

As he waved to the crowds, a <on hindsight, an over-earnest> young man at the front row waved at him, begging him for a photograph. Yara stepped down from the podium and walked towards the boy who handed him a copy of Yara’s election manifesto.  ‘Sign for me, sir, so I may be a small part of Miragian history.’ The crowd cheered and the photographers clicked while Jara, still on the stage, saw what looked like the boy’s belly combusting. The boy’s head then snapped itself from his torso. Jara was thrown back twenty feet, crashing through the back of the podium and landing in the mud outside; miraculously, he only had minor scars. Yara’s body lay scattered: his right hand cruelly landing at the foot of a giant poster of him that read, ‘For A Just Nation’, his face punctured by nails and blackened by the explosion. 

Ella locked herself in her private chambers after the funeral and saw no one but her assistant Ohiy, a former inmate she had befriended while in prison. <Ohiy had, among other things, fulfilled the dual roles of elder sister-figure to Ella and nanny to Jara while in prison. She continued with the latter duties as soon as she was released, bringing up and providing private tuition in Languages and Arithmetic to not one but four Mahasen boys spread over five decades.> The assassination had made Jara, until then a reluctant politician who played the game for his father’s sake, a more focused and dangerous political animal during the day. During the night, he was haunted by that image of the combusting boy <a corrosive memory he would fight every night for the rest of his life>. Yami, pregnant and fragile, moved into her mother’s house to prepare for the birth of her baby. Manal and Hasyl, also unsuccessful in getting their father’s attention, went with her. 

In the final week before she went into labour, Yami confided to her mother unease over a recurrent dream: of seeing a lonely man on the moon who sat watching his world on the blue planet in the distance perish before his very eyes. Every day this dream would advance its narrative, not act by act but scene by scene. And on the seventh day, as Yami lay on the hospital bed, legs spread, she croaked a name repeatedly. Her dream had arrived to its devastating conclusion: the young man who was dying of loneliness was her unborn sun and his name was Deva. ‘I can see what he will become’, she cried to Jara while fighting labour pains, ‘I can see what he will do because he is of all not of one and in my dreams I called out to him, this son I haven’t given birth to yet, as I saw him become one of all with the hindsight of all lifetimes and all memories and I watched the sudden stiffness of his body and knew my son was dying like a star. I am staring into my unborn son’s dying eyes. Do you understand me, Jara?’ She was hysterical. ‘I am staring into my unborn son’s dying eyes at this very moment.’ 

Yami left our Miragian domain as Dev entered it and was freed from his umbilical cord.



His first memory of the Mahasen home was its echo. <Years later in his lunar home, as he watched Mirage being destroyed, he would recall that first memory and experience a terrible nostalgic yearning for that moment in time. He had photographs of his childhood, of course, but those were the images seen through the eyes of other men, at different points in the cycle of life. Nothing from his childhood beaconed with as much light as this aural memory. It seemed to the older Dev that the infant Dev was enchanted by the many voices that reverberated around the hall, stairs and passageways, and drifted into his room: it was his first music.> In the absence of a mother, Dev’s primary maternal influence came from his grandmother and Ohiy. The latter would be the first to greet him in the morning. Opening the curtains every day, she’s let the morning rays hit Dev’s face. The infant Dev then spent the rest of the day in his grandmother’s chambers.  Ohiy sometimes sang. She didn’t possess the voice or the subtlety of a traditional songstress for children: from her Dev learnt the stomping words of revolutionary songs. His grandmother on occasion read to him excerpts from Yara’s unpublished novel. <The opening passage was one of Dev’s favourite as a child: On the day the boy Veda woke up a man, having no knowledge, no memory of time before that very moment, he saw above him the a great blue canvas of sky at the centre of which was a cloud that painted pictures: of a desert oasis that must be found and fertilized with his seed so that a race of men may live and thrive on it. EXCERPT FROM THE UNPUBLISHED NOVEL, A History of Time and Time Again, BY YARA MAHASEN, Pg 1>. This image of promise and hope that tinge new beginnings was especially lucid when uttered by his grandmother. 

The novel though had limited appeal within the family. Jara, haunted as he was by the image of his father’s last moment in time, refused to read it; Manal and Hasyl had no interest in reading at all. It was left to Dev to be the first among the Mahasens to complete reading the patriarch’s only written work. This he did at the crack of dawn on his seventh birthday. 

‘Didn’t you sleep last night? Ohiy was at the door. ‘I saw your light on all night.’

I was reading.

‘Did you manage to get any sleep at all?’

No.

‘Well you can’t be looking glum today. Happy birthday, Master Dev.’ 

Thank you.

‘Get ready for school now.’

Yes, Miss Ohiy.

The breakfast table was laid out. Manal and Hasyl were already seated when Dev walked in, and were waiting for Jara. Dev took his seat. ‘Manal and Hasyl Mahasen, what day is it today? Should I have to remind you of common courtesy? Is this what I have taught you two?’ ‘Happy birthday, little brother’, Manal said. ‘Seven years old, eh? Look at you, all grown up and shit.’ Ohiy looked annoyed at Manal shaking her in disapproval at the language. ‘Sorry, Miss Ohiy.’ ‘Well…wish him a happy birthday now. What’s wrong with you?’ ‘Happy birthday, Dev.’

Thank –  

The sound of many footsteps approaching the table made Dev stop. His father’s gravel voice could be heard in the living room issuing directives to his staff but he was alone when he appeared at the breakfast table. ‘Morning, boys.’ ‘Good morning, father’, the Mahasen brothers said together. ‘Happy birthday, Dev. Why are your eyes red? Are you alright?’ ‘He didn’t sleep well, Mr Mahasen. He was up all night reading.’ ‘Ahh so you finished paataach’s book?’

Yes.

‘Did you like it?’

I did. I want to read it again when I am older and can understand what he was trying to say. You should read it too. 

Jara’s face briefly turned sour. ‘I have no time for stories now, Dev. You know that very well.’ ‘What do you mean you want to read it again?’ Hasyl chimed in. ‘You are like the most boring seven-year-old I ever met.’ Jara caught himself from laughing. ‘Watch it now, Hasyl’, Ohiy was taking her seat at the table. ‘Sorry, Miss Ohiy.’ Hasyl continued staring at Dev and mouthed ‘boring’. A calling bell went off then. ‘Excuse me, Mr Mahasen. Your mother is awake.’ Ohiy left the table. The Mahasens ate breakfast in silence for a while. ‘So...why do you want to read paataach’s book again?’ It was Manal who asked this time, and unlike Hasyl there was no nasty edge to the question. 

Well...when Veda turns a hundred years old his sons, Saman, Shiva and Adam become impatient with their father. They wonder why it was that he hadn’t died yet, but they remain hopeful that he would soon so they prepare themselves to be his rightful heir.

‘Shouldn’t it be the oldest one?’ asked Manal. 

The sons are triplets. 

‘Go on, Dev.’ His father was feigning interest. He wanted this topic closed. 

Years go by and Veda doesn’t die, he is well over a hundred years by then, and his impatient sons begin to fight for their piece of the giant oasis. Their families go to war against each other. They destroy each other and eventually their nation ceases to be. One day Veda wakes up and realizes that Mirage had disappeared and all that was left was an endless desert. He searches every corner of this desert for ten years – Veda doesn’t sleep, doesn’t eat, doesn’t drink any water but he finds no trace of a single man, woman or child. He wonders if it was all just a dream. So he spends the rest of his life learning how to sleep in the hope that he’ll dream the same dream. 

The room was quiet. Every plate except Hasyl’s was half finished. ‘Does he see the same dream?’

The book doesn’t say. 

‘Then what is to gain in reading this book again?’, Jara masked his annoyance well. 

Why didn’t he stop his sons from fighting? 

‘I want to know why you don’t discuss your school work with as much enthusiasm as you do these fairy tales your grandfather cooked up when he was bored’, Jara snapped. 

But this is his only written work, father. 

‘Then why didn’t he have it published then?’ 

Maybe he wanted only his family to read it. 

‘Why would he do that?’ 

I’ll know when I read it again. 

The elder Mahasen sighed. ‘Please stop. I don’t want to discuss that silly book again. Do you understand me?’ 

‘Father, it’s his birthday. Go easy on him.’ 

‘Oh and you are the man of the house now, Manal? Since when? I wasn’t told.’ Jara was now glaring at Manal. His eldest didn’t respond. Even Hasyl, by now going for seconds, stopped eating. ‘Answer me now, Manal. Are you the man of this house?’ ‘No, father.’ ‘Then you’ll not interrupt me when I am disciplining your brother. Clear?’ ‘Yes, father.’ ‘Good’, Jara went back to finishing his plate quickly. ‘I am sorry, Dev. And you too, Manal. I shouldn’t be this grumpy in the morning. It is work you see.’ His plate was now done. ‘I will see you tonight. We’ll have a quiet family dinner.’ 

Manal walked over to Dev. ‘Don’t be upset, little man. You know how he is today.’ 

I am okay. 

‘It is your fault’, Hasyl had found his voice now that Jara and Ohiy weren’t in the room. ‘It is the little fucker’s fault. If he hadn’t kill – ‘Manal’s slap caught Hasyl on the eye above his left cheek. ‘He’s seven. You are his older brother – act like it. I swear I’ll break your fucking -’ His hands over his left eye, a tear streaming down, Hasyl cowered into a corner expecting another blow. 

‘If you act like animals, I am going to throw both of you into a zoo.’

Ohiy had walked in and seen the conflict brewing and hadn’t stopped it, but stepped in when the tension escalated from verbals to physical altercation. ‘Deva, aren’t you hungry?’ 

No, Miss Ohiy.

‘Then you are excused. Your grandmother would like to see you.’

Yes, Miss Ohiy.

‘As for you two idiots’, she said turning towards Manal and Hasyl, ‘Is this the kind of language to use in front of your baby brother?’ Deva left the dining hall as his brothers continued being reprimanded by Ohiy. Ella’s room was the furthest down the hall on the house’s eastern wing. The smell of the balm Ella used to soothe her aching bones wafted out as he got closer to the door. He knocked before entering. His grandmother was seated near the window and watching clouds envelope Mirage’s Peak in the horizon. 

Good morning, aach.

‘Morning, Manal. Happy birthday, child.’

It’s Dev. And thank you.

‘I want to give you a present. Help me to the cupboard please.’ 

Dev pushed the wheelchair towards the cupboard. Stately mahogany, the cupboard was always locked and Ella wore the key on her neck chain. She opened the door and began to rummage through its sparse contents. Suddenly, panic. ‘Where is it? Where is it?! I put it here – I know it! Ohiy – where is she?’ I’ve told her to never move important things from where I’ve kept them. Ohiy!’ she called out. 

What are you looking for?

‘Your paataach’s novel. I think it is time you read it on your own now.’ 

But I’ve already read it.

‘What?’ 

You gave it to me about a month ago. 

‘I did?’

You did. I finished reading it last night. 

‘You did?’

Yes.

Ella then became silent, her eyes settling on an area of nondescript floor. At times it seemed like she was grasping at words that would accurately describe her thought process at that moment, but those words were no longer coming from the wellspring of language; she had to fetch her words from a raging ocean instead, and put it together again so that it would be coherent, normal and Miragian sounding.  Her inability to do so was confusing for Dev to watch. 

Aach…aach?

‘Yes...yes...yes?’

I said I finished reading paataach’s book last night. 

‘I am tired.’

I am sorry I upset you.

‘Why would you upset me, my baby boy?’

I shouldn’t have talked about paataach. 

‘I enjoy speaking about your grandfather. He would be so proud of you right now.’

Did you ever finish reading his book?

‘No’

Why not?

‘Because when he died it was too soon to read it, I couldn’t bear that weight. Then it was too late and I could never remember his words no matter how many times I read it to you.’

I have no one to talk to about his book. 

‘You’re a child. Have simpler pleasures than thinking about a book or who to talk to about a book. Now...help me to bed.’

Dev pushed the chair towards the bed and gave Ella his hand. He had been doing this since he was four and was well acquainted with the delicate measures needed to move the old and frail. ‘I am sorry I forgot to give you a birthday present. My mind, it plays tricks you see.’ 


​					

Dev slept through most of school that day. This wasn’t uncommon: Dev’s early education under Ohiy’s tutelage had provided him an excellent foundational education. Unfortunately, it meant he gave zero attention in class. Teachers, afraid to upset the son of an important politician, let him be. 

Dev dreamt of old man Veda who woke up one morning, listened intently to the world outside and realized that Mirage, his oasis was gone, that his progeny, the bloodline of Vedas was gone. The soft, cool sheets of his bed were now hot sand that burnt the soles of his feet, his naked back and head. Above him, the sun was at its zenith. No cloud, no paintings on the blue canvas this time. He called out for his wife Rahvatpi but she died a long time ago, Veda he told himself as he began his search for the missing oasis. Ten years would pass before he came to a well. His tongue parched, Veda limped to it and dropped the bucket in. Splash! Oh heavenly Mother, my thirst will be quenched. He drew from the well and gulped the liquid whole. His thirst was such that it was only after he had swigged half way through that his malnourished brain warned him: this isn’t water. It was too late. Whatever he had drunk was beginning to take effect. 

<He was one among countless grains of sand being sucked into the black hole of disappearing time. The grain of sand that Veda had become was suffocating; above, beneath, by his sides, other grains of sand were also struggling against the titanic pull of the black hole, the desperate clawing-to-life of the grains below cascading up in hysteria. There were no words to describe this nightmare for the Miragian tongue was born at a time of creation and birth – and knew not what death fully meant. Now Deva was near the black hole. He could feel the cushion of grains below him becoming increasingly fragile. There was a moment of silence then as the final grain beneath him fell into the hole and he knew he was next. Space expanded and Veda felt happy for all the weight of collective memory was gone and he was free – alone still but free. As he fell, he looked around this transient narrow world that heralded his death. He emerged into even more space. And there was light. He could barely open his eyes at the bright glare that greeted his arrival. He looked down as he continued to fall. Yes, below the other grains had lived through this ordeal. They were confused, but they were alive. Veda became part of this rebirthed dune. The world is not an orb but an hourglass! Veda the grain of sand shouted in joy.  

He woke, his face was buried, hot sand was on his tongue and in his mouth, little particles of sand irritated his eyes, tickled his nose. He screamed in pain but there was also joy in his cry. He knew how to rebuild Mirage: he must learn to sleep again. EXCERPT FROM THE UNPUBLISHED NOVEL, A History of Time and Time Again, BY YARA MAHASEN, Pg 67>. 

The sound of the school bell woke Dev up, shattering the beautiful images his grandfather’s words had conjured up, replacing it with his classmates and their inane chatter. The teacher looked exhausted. Dev made his way to the entrance of the school and walked east, but instead of turning into the lane that led to his home, he continued straight towards the Eastern Boroughs, known for its sole landmark: The Miragian National Library. 

This was Dev’s first time in the library and its sheer size overwhelmed him. The library looked like the inside of a giant beehive. Dev half expected it to sound like a beehive, but instead there was an echo. A girl’s voice monologued in the distance. Dev realized she was reading out aloud. He followed the voice, a voice that didn’t so much read but sang the words off the pages. Soon he was going up stairs, down hallways and finally into a dusty corridor that led to a door on which read a sign DIRECTOR REJOG C RACKEL. The voice came from behind the door. Dev opened the door and peeped in. The singing stopped. 

She was petite and her eyes seemed to always smile.  ‘Who is it, Ana?’ An old man’s voice then asked. He was seated with his back turned to the door. ‘I don’t know, grandfather.’ ‘Yes, who is it?’ the old man asked without turning his back. 

Err…I am sorry, I just heard your voice and – sorry I didn’t realize. Sorry. 

‘Wait, wait, young man. Come in here please.’ Dev walked in and towards the old man. He stood by the old man, but his and gaze remained towards his granddaughter. ‘Stand in front of me, please,’ Dev walked closer, realizing then that the old man was blind. ‘What is your name, young master?’ 

Deva, sir. 

‘How old are you?’

I am seven years old, sir. 

‘And what are you doing here all alone? Are your parents with you?’

No, sir. 

‘Hmm. What are you looking for in my library then?’

Dev didn’t respond. 

‘Well?’ 

I am not sure how to pronounce it, sir. Can you help me? 

‘Well, I imagine I can be of some help. I am the Director of this fine library, young man. I am also its only librarian. And these days, I am one of its few readers; my granddaughter, Anaka, being among our small army of warriors. That is her seated in front of me. Say hello, Ana.’ 

Hello, Anaka. 

Dev didn’t hear her response. He admired the grace of her lips in uttering the word instead. 

‘Now what is it that you can’t pronounce?’ Dev snapped back to attention. 

Can I spell it for you, sir? 

‘Go ahead.’ 

E-T-H-A-N-E  A-G-A-U-N-T-H-A-R-K-A-R-U-M-hyphen-N-U

The old man smirked, ‘Mythology. Interesting. How old are you again?’ 

Seven, sir. 

‘Splendid! I have good news and bad news, young man. The bad news is neither I nor the writer who came up with that name know how it is pronounced. The good news is I now know who has the manuscript in which that four-handed God is mentioned: you. Which means you must be a Mahasen, the youngest of the lot. Deva Mahasen, yes?’

Yes, sir. 

‘Splendid! So you finished reading your grandfather’s book then?’ 

How do you know?

‘We were friends, Yara and I.’

You’ve read it?

‘Read it? The entire thing was a private joke between the two of us.’

A….joke?

‘Yes. We used to drink together as youngsters, you see? And one day, your grandfather got drunk and said, “Wouldn’t it be hilarious if all the major religions – Samanism, Shivasim and Adamite - were founded in today’s age of knowledge and increased technology?” That is, if our so-called First Ancestors had science at their disposal when they had their revelation, would it still prove to be that - a revelation? Or merely a subjective experience that had no business being committed to paper, much less influence our daily lives for thousands of years thereafter? Without the magic and mystery, would those words still count? Or will our better senses born from reason shirk it, dismiss it for the nonsense that it is? That is the question. I said that we would. He said no, that humanity will always clutch to convenience of well-resolved stories that comfort the masses, that people didn’t mind if this myth came at a time when our ancestors were learning to use primitive tools or if it was revealed at a time when we have technology at our behest.’ 

I didn’t understand what you just said, sir. 

The old man laughed, ‘The point is, young Master Mahasen, is that your grandfather and I made a bet. He wrote A History of Time and Time Again to prove that a plausible alternative creation myth can be written in this day and age, and sold to the masses using technology. If his political career hadn’t picked up like it did, he just might have published the book and pursued that goal. Who knows what would have happened then? He could have ended up a religious martyr – instead of a mere political one.’ 

For the rest of the afternoon, Dev listened to Rejog’s ranting about the need for science and reason to supersede mythology and superstition, and aim, quite literally, for the stars. ‘Here’s proof: while we Miragians pontificate about us being the chosen people of this omnipotent Maternal Being who lives on the moon, fight among ourselves for this tiny oasis between a vast arid desert in the east and an endless sheet of sand in the south, those Circadians – do you know what those men have done?’ 

No, sir. 

‘They’ve gone to the moon’, he said the words slowly. ‘They’ve walked on its surface!’ Dev, still orienting himself from the effect of Ana’s eyes, was devastated. This was too much to bear. 

But Mother Mirage chose us! We should be on the moon. 

‘It is because they are unbelievers, my boy. They looked at these holy scripts like our Book of Mirage and saw no message was intended for them. If the First Ancestors did in fact exist, the Circadians told themselves, then they didn’t evidently give a fart about them. So they decided to go at it on their own. And they went looking for truth through science. And you know what else they found?’ 

No, sir. 

‘There are no First Ancestors, Deva. We came from the stars and through years of creating and destroying, through fire and water, as fish and mammal, as ape and then as men before we adopt an identity as Samanian, Shivaputra or Adamite. We are all star dust, made from the same building blocks that gave life to the tree that was felled so that they can make the chair you are sitting on right now.’ 

Ana, seated by Dev’s side, turned towards him, hoping her eyes would meet his, and comfort this boy who was unaccustomed to her grandfather’s ramblings. 

Today is my birthday. 

This caught even the quick-witted Rejog by surprise. ‘Oh my sweet boy. Happy birthday.’ 

We don’t celebrate my birthday. 

‘Why not?’ asked Ana. 

‘Ana, stop being so inquisit –‘ 

Because my mother died giving birth to me. 

The old man sighed. 

Dev was no longer looking at the floor. He turned towards Ana. 

Can I celebrate my birthday with the two of you? 

<Rejog had Anaka run to the cafeteria and buy cake and sweets. An hour later Dev walked out of the library having celebrated his birthday for the first time, contemplating the immensity of Rejog’s knowledge, and infinity in Ana’s eyes, when the fireflies appeared. It was only dusk but they were already playing in the shadows by the bushes. Dev ran towards them like any child would. Were these minute beings as enchanted by this little human boy as he was by them? It appeared so because the fireflies let Deva join in their play. The hundreds that were there at that moment relayed this message of communion with a child of another species to the rest of the colony and they too joined, all ten thousand fireflies dancing around this little boy on the pavement of a narrow avenue. Was Rejog’s revelation of men walking on the moon alone responsible for planting that idea in the young Dev? Or was it the magical unity he felt with the fireflies that must share blame for the lunatic resolution – to live on the moon – he made to himself that day?>  

It was six hours since school was done and Dev hadn’t still returned. It was in the midst of minor panic at the Mahasen household when Dev finally walked through the gates.  ‘And where have you been?’, Jara’s question was laced with resignation. 

I was at the library. 

‘All day? Really? Why?’ 

I wanted to check something. 

‘School homework?’ 

No. 

‘Then what?’ 

Grandpa’s book mentioned – 

‘Oh for fuc – ‘, Jara stopped himself. He paused. ‘Do you know what today is?’ 

Dev didn’t respond. 

‘Do you know what today is?’ 

Yes. 

‘And do you remember what I said during breakfast?’ 

Yes. 

‘And what was that?’

Dev looked around the hall. Manal was looking towards him, willing him to remember. Hasyl was openly enjoying this. Ohiy remained unmoving at the foot of the stairs. ‘You don’t remember?’ 

No. 

‘What made you forget? What was so interesting about this thing you read in my father’s book then?
Tell us, Dev.’ 

Dev remained quiet. 

‘Are you going to talk?’ 

I was celebrating my birthday in the library. 

‘With who?’

Friends, father. 

‘You don’t have friends, little brother’, Hasyl said. ‘You watch your fucking mouth, I’ve told you’, Manal moved towards Hasyl; it was only Jara’s glare that stopped him. Jara turned towards Dev again. ‘You see this? Your family is fighting instead of celebrating the memory of your mother. Are you happy now?’ Ohiy had had enough: ‘Jara - Mr Mahasen, I’ll speak to the boy. Please he is only a – ‘

It isn’t my fault!

‘What did you say?’

All of you – you look at me like I am the reason there is so much misery in this house. It isn’t my fault! I am leaving. 

‘And where will you go?’ 

It was then a strong gust of wind blew into the hall from an open window, gently tugged the drawn curtains apart, and revealed the full moon over the skies of Mirage. And Dev, pointing at the moon, announced then, that, father, that will be my home one day, and Jara sighed like fathers do and said, ‘Miragians are meant for the earth, son, not for the skies’. 

But it was the fireflies.  

‘Fireflies?’ 

Ten thousand fireflies showed me my fate lies on the moon.

‘You’re too young to know what fate is.’ 

Does it matter? We are all insects. The fate of fireflies is to eat. Ours is to dream. 

His father sighed, ‘Your fate will be your brothers’, your brothers’ fate will be yours, your fate will be the same as mine and your grandfather’s: Our fate is in the hands of the people of Mirage. Our fate – your fate, Dev – will be in those ballot boxes - not on the moon. Do you understand? Happy birthday. Go to sleep. Good night.’ 



Over the next ten years Jara set in motion plans that would make him the most powerful politician in modern Miragian history. It started when he was offered the Ministry of Labour. The media applauded: this, they said, was a fitting role <for a man whose family had profoundly and irrevocably altered the landscape of the ministry’s remit decades ago> that would prepare him for the inevitable: his candidacy for Presidency in five years’ time. By then His Excellency President Jaruna Abey would have completed his second term – the old man had had enough of politics. Jara would be the obvious candidate for succession.   

Upon taking up his duties, Jara gave an interview to the Miragian which left no doubt in readers’ minds of his political ambitions, displaying for his future electorate his everyman credentials. <That his ideas – and even the language used - were ‘borrowed’ and adapted from the labour policies of the ultra-left leaning Circadian President of the time, His Excellency Stannel Paras Mead, was left unsaid in the papers. ‘That any Miragian citizen should receive less than a comfortable living age as regular payment for their industriousness, that we still refer to a broad spectrum of our working population in as crass a phrase as “sweated trades”, that we allow little organization, little bargaining power to these most necessary trades, these are not signs of progress, but a condition of progressive degeneration.’> His proposal to create a Miragian Wages Board to enforce higher minimum wages in six industries <printing, civil administration, fisheries, agriculture, military and paper mills> almost single-handedly assured victories for the Miragian Workers’ Party at every provincial and state elections, leading to the all-important Presidential Elections. With no rival within the party to contest him for nomination, the Miragian Workers’ Party unanimously voted Jara Mahasen as their candidate for the Presidential Elections of ’09. 

That is when the nightmare overflowed from the tarred depths of his sleep. He was on stage waving to his supporters when a voice in his head posed questions: What if they want to kill you too, Jara? What assurance do you have that your father’s fate won’t be yours? You walk in the path he paved for you; is it not natural that you would face the same perils too? The speech that day was a disaster; his head scrambled, Jara mumbled platitudes that left the crowd bored. A number of his entourage on stage was photographed asleep. That image was plastered on the front page of The Miragian under an almost mocking headline the next day: Was Jara too overwhelmed by the expectations, the headline asked. 

Jara excused himself from the breakfast table surrounded by his political advisors, spending minutes on his knees vomiting into the toilet. He promised himself that he would answer the insolent editor’s question in a resounding manner. Jara delivered impassioned speeches at every stage, in towns and villages, thereafter. The same writer compared Jara’s oratory skills to his legendary father’s. 

Inside, however, Jara’s mind found new ways to poke at this fear of being assassinated. When people waved at him, he imagined one of those hands would belong to a skill knife-thrower who would use this sea of limbs as cover to carry out his contract. He had to stop his hands from shivering when he was told by his advisors to mingle with the common folk. Even their apparent adoration was not enough to convince him. While shaking hands, kissing the foreheads of toddlers, and consoling sickly old men and women one day, Jara had to summon all his strength to stop himself from urinating in nervous fright. But this conflict of circumstance and spirit, this inability to resolve his personal fears with his deepest ambition, manifested itself most damagingly in his rare moments at home. He barely spent any time with Ella who had lost all mental and physical control of herself and her body. Following his nomination, a photo-op with his iconic mother was arranged for by The Miragian. As the photographer fixed their pose, he sniffed at the air. Jara got the smell too: his mother had shit herself.  Embarrassed and angry, Jara excused himself from the room and didn’t pay a visit to his mother’s chambers for months thereafter. Ohiy understood why: he didn’t want the anger to be directed at his mother. Instead it was channelled towards his eldest and youngest sons. 

Manal had long given up trying to please his father. He returned from a six month stay in Circadia a different man, buoyed by the cultural revolutions taking place there. 

What’s that you are smoking?

Manal looked at his brother, now 17, and after a pause offered him the paper cone-like stick stuffed 
with the green herb he was smoking.

What’s this?

‘Go on, try it.’ 
	
Dev hesitated. 

‘Come on, I am your older brother. I am not going to give you something dangerous.’ 
What does it do?

‘Depends. For me, it pauses time – everything is still and calm, like a photograph. The older you get, the faster time seems to roll. Fast’, he snapped his fingers. ‘One day you are 18, playing the role of the perfect eldest child – and then you smoke this, sit back and wonder why the fuck you are doing anything for anyone besides yourself. Point is I realized I don’t want to play the role of the perfect son.’ 

What do you want to do?

‘I want to be a photographer.’ 

Dev put the rolled paper with the herb in his mouth. Manal lit it. Dev inhaled and then coughed non-stop. Manal laughed. When Dev’s coughing stopped, he understood a little of what Manal had just said. It felt like time had slowed down indeed, that if he concentrated hard time would no longer be the whizzing ghost that gave no moment to men but a figure, possibly human in mould. 

You know father expects you to be his successor, right?

‘Let him win the elections first before thinking of succession and shit. Also, I am his heir because I am the eldest? Come on, Dev. No, he knows better. He picked his heir a long time ago.’ 

How is that? 

‘A few years ago, I was helping him write a speech. He insisted on a ridiculous line – I can’t remember what it was now – wait – “We are humble men and women, from humble homes made warm by the hard toil of our men.” Or something equally idiotic. I laughed when he dictated the line to me.’ 

He didn’t take it too well? 

‘He slapped me. Asked me why I thought it was funny. I was like, “Look around you! How is our life humble in any way?” I found it crass and irresponsible that he thought we led humble lives, that we can even begin to empathize with daily struggles of the masses.’

Hasyl? 

‘He’s always been a politician, just rough around the edges, too angry and stupid when he was young. Why do you think father prodded him towards the military? Boy needs structure in his life. Someone barking orders for him to follow.’ 

Father’s a pretty angry man himself. 

‘He wasn’t always like that. Paatach’s death fucked him up proper. Now that we are on the subject –‘ 

Hmm? 

‘Hasyl - is there any improvement in how he treats you?’

He ignores me almost completely if that is what you call ‘improvement’. 

‘Look he’s always been an angry kid. Even when mother was around. I couldn’t explain it then.’ 

How about now? He blames me for everything wrong in this household. 

Manal was silent now. ‘I am sorry if we gave you that impression. I didn’t think that at all.’ 

I know you didn’t but Hasyl walked around saying I kill –

‘-stop right there. You didn’t. Get over it. And honestly, fuck Hasyl. Look he’s always needed someone or something to blame. Before you came along, we used to fight like wild animals – which is Miss Ohiy is always saying she’ll throw us into a zoo. Anyway, he’d start a fight, I’d kick his ass, and he’d go crying to father saying I was bullying him.’ 

Thanks for looking after me. 

‘No problem, little brother. Now you want another puff of this or what?’ 


Manal’s rebelliousness first found outlet in his mid-twenties. Brooding on the inside, cheerful on the out, he knew little besides the political landscape of Mirage. That changed the day he met Nnae, the daughter of the Circadian ambassador. He saw her at a Diplomatic Ball and followed her as she made an elaborate method of leaving the hall undetected. When she slipped into the greenhouse in the backyard, Manal was already there but managed a genuine look of surprise when she stepped in. 

‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to disturb you’, she said. She was fair-skinned like all Circadians, full lips and sported a permanent smirk. ‘That’s alright’ Manal said, ‘I am not busy or anything.’

She nodded and for the next few minutes the two youngsters walked around the greenhouse without speaking a word to one another. 

‘You are Minister Mahasen’s son, aren’t you?’ 

‘That obvious?’

‘I’ve seen your pictures in the newspaper. They say your father will be the next President of Mirage.’ 

Manal changed the subject immediately. ‘What brings you here?’ 

‘To the ball? My father is –‘

‘- I know, the Ambassador. I meant what brings you here, to the greenhouse, while your father’s party is in full swing upstairs?’ 

‘I wanted to listen to music.’

‘They are playing music upstairs.’ 

‘Not my music.’

‘You are musician?’ 

‘No, I mean yes. But that’s not what I meant. I am here to listen to music I like.’ 

‘And how are you going to do that?’ 

‘With this’, she said taking out a black rectangular box with a bright screen from her bag. 

‘You Circadians and your playthings. What is that?’

‘This is a device to carry your music around – all your music - anywhere you go.’ 

‘That’s the most ridiculous and wonderful thing I’ve ever heard.’ 

‘Want to listen?’ Manal nodded. He was a decent musician, but not a passionate one. Miragian music didn’t stir anything inside of him. 

But Manal had never heard anything like the music of Circadia before. The Circadians, unlike Miragians, wrote music to match the full spectrum of the human condition, Nnae said. ‘I mean, to have at your disposal a tool as perfectly suited to hold a mirror to humanity’s joys and sorrows but not to use it to represent our anger, our misanthropy, our undiluted hate even - isn’t that a waste?’ 

Manal agreed with Nnae’s reasoning. In fact, he was smitten – by the music and by this Circadian priestess who seemed to invoke her country’s music with a mere press of a button. She invited him over to the house the next day for an extended listening session. In this manner, Nnae introduced Manal to music and musicians of such varied complexity and texture and moods that he wondered, If this is how much of music is deprived to a typical Miragian, how much of truth is being held back, moulded differently to meet the motives of Miragians rulers?

He still entertained a healthy sexual desire for her but hadn’t acted on it for fearing of losing this sole contact to a different world. Nnae, realizing his predicament, decided to follow the advice of a friend: she’d offer Manal a puff of the herb Kanab, the bud of which was said to have aphrodisiac properties.  

‘What’s this?’ Manal asked when he was presented with his first joint. 

‘Smoke it, trust me.’ 

‘I don’t smoke.’ 

‘This is just a plant called the Kanab. We Circadians smoke it in social gatherings.’ 

‘What does it do?’

‘You’ll see.’

Manal felt a great intensity of connecting to the music of that day. A man, armed with guitar and a voice scarred by tobacco, sang a rambunctious tune about a legendary nymph called The Black Widow to who married men would turn when they had grown tired of their wives. The Black Widow demanded only one thing in return for a night of unspeakable pleasures: the complete submission of the man – his body, mind and soul – at the altar of her bed. I am yours, prey on me the man begged her in verse. Nnae kissed Manal’s cheek then, but the texture of the kiss quickly transformed before he could react. Her tongue traced its way up his cheek and to his ear lobe. The song too was evolving, a woman’s voice provided the song’s lyrical counterpoint: The Black Widow weaves, tonight she weaves on ye. Nnae sang, whisper-singing the refrain She weaves on ye. She took his right hand, licked each finger and guided the wet finger tips under her skirt. His fingers plunged into her moist, warm flesh. She yelped and held him back. ‘Gently’, she rebuked. With her hands grasping his wrist, she guided him in, helping Manal finding the right rhythm. It took a while but the effect of the Kanab and the music made him increasingly confident. Soon there was song from her again, but this time she wasn’t singing along to The Black Widow; no, this was her own song, sung in some primordial tongue, of different timbres and tones indecipherable to him; where the tempo changed from aimless, plodding wistfulness to possessed pacing and guttural moans. Nnae’s body arched, her head snapped backwards, mouth agape, she held his wrist even tighter, plunging his index and ring finger deeper into herself. Manal’s aching fingers felt the warm wetness of a woman in uncontrollable climax. Her body writhed and her skin rippled. Loosening her grip on his wrist, Nnae fell like a puppet whose strings had been cut. She lifted her skirt and spread her legs wider. ‘I am not done weaving on you. Remember’, she whispered into his ear as he hurriedly entered her: 

‘Body. 

Mind. 

Soul. 

Manal.’

They were loud and messy that afternoon. It would have been a scandal had it not been raining so hard that the gardening staff had left their duties for the day, leaving the couple to explore the entirety of the greenhouse as they explored each other’s bodies. Exhausted, they were on the floor, still naked, little petals and soil sticking to their sweaty bodies. Nnae broke the news then: ‘I am going back to Circadia for the holidays’, she said as she mounted him again, guiding his hands to her hips this time. ‘Come with me.’ 



At that moment in a different part of Mirage, as Manal considered going to this Circadian woman’s homeland, Hasyl’s name was called to come up on stage and receive his Lieutenant Commission. He had graduated top of his class and was weeks away from starting duties as Special Assistant to General Facēnos, the Commander of the Miragian Army. His father stood beaming on stage. ‘Good lad’, Jara said, lowering his voice as father and son shook hands in front of an adoring audience. ‘You’ve done well.’ 

Hasyl was ten when he watched his grandfather blown to pieces live on Miragian Vision. He ran close to the screen as the camera, shaken by the sheer force of the blast, desperately sought to capture the happenings on the now damaged stage. Where is father? Father?! The camera was in frenzy still as the terrified crowd ran amok, screaming for their lives and loved ones. A man walked in front of the camera, his spectacles shattered like a sheet of ice, his clothes torn, blood dripping from countless shards of glass that had ripped into his skin. I can’t hear anything. Please. I can’t hear anything the dazed man cried.  No one else was in the living room as the Mahasen boys watched Miragian history and personal tragedy write itself. Ohiy stormed into the living room then: ‘What in the name of Mother Mirage are you two doing? I’ve been calling you for dinner for the last five mi – ‘

The camera had now regained its orientation. Its focus was on a decapitated head of Yara Mahasen. ‘- oh please, no!’ She switched off the screen. ‘Miss Ohiy, no!’ Hasyl protested. ‘I want to see if father is hurt.’ Ohiy’s hands shook. Ella walked into the room then. ‘What’s going on?’ A strange gnawing. ‘What’, Ella began, ‘What did they show on Vision?’ Ohiy and the two boys were speechless. ‘Tell me. Ohiy?’ she stood directly in front of Ohiy. ‘Step aside then.’ Ella turned on the VS. 

The funeral was a close casket affair. Hasyl stood between his mother to his left and his father to the right. Hasyl and Manal felt Jara’s hand grip tighten as the funeral pyre burnt into the night sky. The next day they learnt that this moment had been preserved for all memory by a fortunate photographer: he showed the Mahasen men as silhouettes against the burning funeral pyre, bidding farewell to their fallen patriarch <Colour photography and printing had just been introduced to Mirage a few months ago; this image would be specially evocative to a population who had become desensitized to the monochrome images of old. There was fire in the background, dancing in its orange rage, here were the black silhouettes of four figures in the foreground – man, woman, boys – whose personal tragedy was also a Miragian tragedy> It made the front page under the headline: The Birth of the Mahasen Era. <Miragian history tells us that some bloodlines have a cosmic responsibility to take the reins of our nation. This history tells us that such noble duties fall on only certain clans: the Facēnos, the Welakoti, and the Abeys. This history is so ingrained in us that the masses lead their lives thinking these clans urinate wine and defecate ice cream. It is now time to state the obvious: This Miragian history is patently false. The time of the so-called noble blooded is coming to an end. Yesterday we said our farewell to a true Miragian hero. He wasn’t born of noble blood. He was born in a home like ours. His worries were ours, our worries his. He was us. He was a hero and a true Miragian patriot - and if history is just it will record him as one. Yesterday the nation cremated this great Miragian but it will not allow his memory to pass. It must not. His work must continue. His vision must come true. May he Rest in Peace. EXCERPT FROM THE BIRTH OF THE MAHASEN ERA, The Miragian, BY JARLAP, A (3092[2592], October 10), pp. A1, A4> Hasyl never forgot the intimacy of that moment – and was secretly thankful to the brave photographer for daring to capture it. After Yami died giving birth to Dev three months later, Hasyl visited his school library to seek out this issue of The Miragian. There, as the librarian stood helpless, Hasyl cut out the photograph from the library’s copy and took the clipping home. 

Grief hung over the Mahasen home. Friends remarked among themselves that laughter, curiosity, surprise and joy would have left the Mahasen spirit completely had it not been for the infant Dev. All members of the Mahasen household gravitated towards the baby, seeking solace from their grief, except Jara and Hasyl. One day Hasyl walked by Dev’s nursery and heard his infant brother awake and crying. No one was in the room at the time. Hasyl entered the room and watched the tiny creature who not so much cried but screamed like a hundred terrified birds. He was a month old and this was the first time Hasyl had seen him properly. Why Hasyl asked the insolent creature did you have to come in and ruin everything? The question Hasyl posed the infant was built on the strength of his ten-year-old sense of logic: mother left this home and father to prepare for your arrival – our perfect family will no longer be whole without mother – your arrival killed mother – therefore you are to be blamed. For everything, little brother. Hasyl left the room, leaving his infant brother to cry. This silly assertion, that an infant was to blame for his family’s fate to forever court tragedy, would have died a natural death as he became older and wiser; instead Hasyl made the error of allowing the wound to fester, infecting other parts of his psyche. Hasyl’s anger turned into hate when he realized Manal was growing closer to, and protective of, the infant. It was this malady that convinced Jara to send his favourite son to military school so that he could reign in the rage before it was too late. 

‘You know why you must go?’ Jara asked Hasyl the night before he was to leave for military school. Hasyl nodded. ‘You know what you must do?’ Again, Hasyl nodded. 

When his two eldest sons were in their mid-teens, Jara knew who would become the politician and who would play the prodigal one. Manal was too open to ideas, not tethered to the vision of a Mahasen hegemony as Hasyl showed all the inclinations of being.  Hasyl was, on the other hand, obedient to his father’s every bidding, and knew why a certain thing was said – without any great pontificating on Jara’s part on the need to be moored to the family’s way, his way. But the anger threatened to derail Hasyl’s obvious aptitude for climbing the ladder. It was over an afternoon cup of tea with General Facēnos when the latter put forward the suggestion. Jara found the idea agreeable from the outset. Hasyl, too, agreed without hesitation when he was asked if he would consider a military career.  That phase of the plan was now in its fruition. 

‘Good lad. You’ve done well’, Jara repeated to Hasyl, looking at him straight in the eye. Both men sported a smile on their faces. <The subsequent photograph of this moment was never published on the papers, but Hasyl located the photographer and got himself a reprint.> 

 ===

‘You see those five stars right over the eastern horizon?’ 

Dev nodded. 

‘That’, Ana continued as they lay on a flat rock outside her family’s country home, ‘is Odonata, the dragonfly. Native Circadian mythology tells us how Odonata, the brave, virgin warrior goddess, would be invoked by chieftains when all hope was lost on the battlefield. If the chieftain was on the side of good and engaged in battle purely in the defence of his tribe then Odonata would respond to the call and defeat his enemies.’

But this is a dragonfly, not a woman. 

‘Let me finish, Dev. I’ll get to that’, Ana snapped. ‘The legend continues that one day, The Old Man, The Great Unknown, the lord of all gods happened upon Chief Ruku’s wife, Sta, bathing in the rivers. Enraptured by her beauty, The Old Man invokes all of nature – the birds, the wind, the water, the fish, the flowers - to sing a song in her name. When the song was done, The Old Man said, “I commanded all the world to sing an ode for ye, fair Sta. The world is at my feet. I am at thine. Be mine and thy beauty will be ageless from this moment!” Instead of being seduced by this act, Sta is left terrified. She refuses his advances despite knowing that this was the lord of all gods. The Great Unknown then whisks her away to his celestial abode and rapes her. When Chief Ruku hears of this, he orders all the temples built in The Great Unknown’s name to be burnt to the ground. This angers The Great Unknown who descends into the Circadian realms with the bruised Sta by his side. The Great Unknown burns every man, woman and child in Ruku’s tribe, making the helpless chief watch as each member of his tribe disintegrated in to ashes. The desperate Chief Ruku invokes Odonata then: “I beseech thee, warrior maiden. Aid us and we will forever be thy most devout servants.” The Great Unknown was Odonata’s great-great-great grandfather, but she was a kind and just Goddess, and not one to refuse her cosmic responsibility. She rode to meet The Old Man in battle. Upon seeing Odonata challenge him, The Old Man laughed so hard that the sky turned grey and it started raining and didn’t stop for another hundred years thereafter. Incensed, Odonata charged at him, her sword stopping inches from The Old Man’s face. The Great Unknown hadn’t moved. He smiles evilly at her instead. “Thou art the patriarch of all living things, Great Father! Please! I beseech thee: let these people live, set Sta free”, she begs him. The Old Man continues to smile menacingly. In tears, Odonata called on all her strength and plunged the sword into The Old Man’s face. Nothing happens to The Old Man, but Chief Ruku watches in horror as Odonata is sucked in, sword-first, into the unfathomable depths of The Great Unknown’s black eyes. The Old Man then spat her out. Cocooned in his saliva, Odonata’s form had changed. She was no longer the beautiful virgin warrior goddess. She was an insect unlike anything seen before. She had been turned into a dragonfly.  And that, Dev’, Anaka said, ‘is how I got my middle name, Odonata. Anaka-Odonata Ziromt.’ 

I can’t believe you’ve never told me your middle name before, and it is a beautiful name, Anaka-Odonata. 

Dev found himself lost in her again. Ten years had passed since he first met Anaka and her eccentric grandfather in an empty library. Ten years and it seemed everyday he found new reasons to go weak in her presence – and new ways of not being able to tell her the one truth. 

<Dev would grapple all his life with this concept of ‘The One Truth’. At seven, fermenting in his grandfather’s novel take on Miragian mythology, Dev’s submission for his school short story competition, titled ‘The War of the Shapes’, focussed on a fight for geometric superiority; essentially which shape was the most important for the sane functioning of the mortal world. The shapes fight one another in order to gain the affection of man. In the final battle, the Circle emerges as victor because man realizes it had always been, and always will be, the circle that best captured the geometry of his own fate. At seventeen, Dev penned a poem in three parts titled, ‘The One Truth’. In the poem he imagines the world anew, sans human presence except for Anaka and he, a world in genesis that they were tasked to populate with their progeny. The poem sets the scene of this new, virgin world, creates Dev and Anaka from the ashes of exploding stars, and charts their individual journeys over mountains, through swamps, and across deserts, in search of one another. When they finally find each other on top of a hill they realize, that in their haste to seek the other out, neither knew to speak. Unable to communicate their love for one another, they spend the rest of their lives quietly creating language, a Miragian tongue, so that they may finally utter ‘The One Truth’, their first utterance to one another. The poem’s devastating conclusion sees an old and weak Dev at Anaka’s deathbed. Grief-stricken and alone, unable to still put into words his loss, he finally blurts out the simple sentences he had spent his lifetime constructing, ‘The One Truth’: ‘I love you, Anaka. I have always loved you.’>


​					

‘Go on. Open it.’ 

Dev tore the wrapping paper. Inside, framed in mahogany wood, was a wide-angle photograph of the blue planet as seen from the moon. The image was called ‘Gaiarise’. Breathless, Dev ran his fingers over the blue orb floating against inky darkness. 

‘We live and die in that fragile blue marble. This is home, Dev. This is here. I wish I could see this it for myself.’

It’s beautiful, Rejog. Thank you. 

‘You still want to live on the moon?’ 

I still want to live on the moon – if only to see this with my own eyes, Rejog. How did you get this?

‘The Circadian Space Agency presented this to me on my sixtieth. They had no idea I was – ‘  

What’s wrong? 

‘Nothing, nothing. They had no idea I was blind by then.’ Rejog’s laughter sounded like a lament. ‘Anyway, I’ve been wanting to pass it on to someone who would appreciate it. I thought of you.’ 

I am grateful. 

The library was as empty that day as it was when Dev first walked into it eight years before. Celebrating his birthday at the library with Rejog and Ana had become a tradition since the day he walked into Rejog’s room. Ana was arranging the tray with cake and tea. She hadn’t still wished Dev and the wait was maddening. 

‘Have you been viewing the moon through your telescope?’ Rejog’s question broke Dev from his reverie. 

Yes, Rejog. Every night. Full moon in two days.

‘Tea’s served, grandpa.’ ‘Thank you, dear. Happy birthday, Dev.’

Again, Dev looked in Ana’s direction. Again, she seemed to avoid his gaze. Why? Why hasn’t she wished me yet? Ana was helping Rejog with drinking his tea. When finished, she fed him a bite of the cake. ‘That’s all?’ Rejog asked. He sounded childlike in his disappointment. ‘That’s all’, Ana smiled but her voice was stern. ‘You are tougher to crack than your mother, Ana. Of that, there is no doubt.’ She kissed him on the cheek.  ‘Better’, Rejog said and smiled back. ‘You two can do as you wish. You don’t need to keep an old man company.’  ‘Does the old man wish to take his afternoon nap?’ The banter between grandfather and granddaughter was among the many things he enjoyed about their company. ‘The old man does wish to take his afternoon nap, yes.’ ‘That’s fine then’, Ana said and began to clear the table. ‘Dev, help me with these please?’ 

He kept looking for her eyes to meet his as they took the cups and tray back to the canteen, but again there was reticence. 

Stop. 

‘What?’  They were in a corridor leading to Rejog’s private office. 

You know I only celebrate my birthday with the two of you, right? Then why haven’t you wished me yet? 

Ana let out a deep sigh. ‘I am sorry. We took him to the doctor today for his check-up. His condition is getting worse. The doctor says –‘,Tears rolled down her eyes. Dev held her hands. ‘The doctor says he has a year to go – at most.’ She was weeping. Dev led her to one of the small study halls that characterized the top floor of the library. He sat near as she silently wept. When she was done, she looked up at him, eyes swollen, and forced a smile on her face. ‘Happy birthday, Dev. I am sorry you had to see this today.’

How is the family taking the news?

‘Mama isn’t handling it well. Papa, well, I don’t know if he knows. Not sure if he cares. Miragian diplomacy in more important than family! Sorry. Anyway, mama and I are taking grandpa to our country home. And that leads me to my birthday present for you.’ 

This is not the time, Ana. 

‘Shush, Master Mahasen’, she always teased by calling him that during arguments. 

Alright, I will. What is my birthday present then?

‘Come with us to the hill country.’

I’ve never been to the hill country. 

‘Precisely why you should come. Stay with us for a week. You’ll love it.’

I’d love to, Ana, but I am in the midst of – 

‘Dammit, boy. It’s your birthday!’, she was annoyed. ‘You’ve spent more time in your life inside a library or reading a book than you have outside in the midst of nature. The constant smell of musty old books might intoxicate your mind, but it won’t nourish your lungs. The hill country will. Trees will. Come with us.’ 

<Years later, as he sat looking at Gaia rising over the lunar horizon, the blue marble planet that was home to all those memories, Dev would recall his first visit to the Rackel country home as the happiest week of his life.> 

						*

They were at the Temple of Mirage <sometimes referred to as the Temple of Butterflies> atop Mirage’s Peak. Ana had taken him hiking in the three days since they arrived at her family’s country house. ‘I will make you walk, Dev Mahasen’, she teased him. ‘I will make you walk so much that your city boy legs will cry and beg for mercy.’ She kept to that promise. On the first day – ‘Since you are a city boy we’ll start with a simple walk through the forest’ – the hike started after breakfast; it was mid-afternoon under a scorching sun when they returned. The next day, she proposed that they climb the rock Shivagala. <Shivagala, according to the locals, was a rock that stubbed the toe of their First Ancestor, Shiva, cracking its peak.> Its flat summit meant the climb was less exhausting, but the April sun ensured they didn’t take it lightly. While enjoying the view at the summit, Ana said: ‘Tomorrow we climb Mirage’s Peak, we go to the Temple of Mirage. If the weather holds and it is a clear day, you’ll be able to see all of Mirage from the temple.’ 

They left the house after midnight the next day. The climb, an ascent up 10,000 stairs to the temple, would take about four hours. 

‘You are lucky.’

How is that now?

‘These stairs are usually crowded with people, sometimes as many as five thousand people climb on a single day. Today, we are the only ones.’ 

You’ve done this alone before?

‘Oh, plenty of times. When grandpa was young, he used to take mama up to the temple every month.’

I never thought of your grandfather as being religious. 

‘He wasn’t. He once found a Ghost Orchid, the rarest orchid in all of Pangaea, at the temple. That thing is called Ghost Orchid for a reason – it was mostly myth until it was properly collected and categorized fifty years ago. Anyway, he kept going there till he became blind, hoping to see it again, never did. Mama used to take me up as well until I started doing the climb myself.’ 

Did you ever see the Ghost Orchid?

‘No. Botanists have told grandpa that he probably never saw the Ghost Orchid either, that the climate up there is unsuitable for it to grow.’ 

Did he agree with them?

‘What do you think?’

Your grandfather can be a stubborn man.

Ana laughed. ‘That he can, yes – he didn’t give up chasing for it even after science told him he was wrong.’ Pause. ‘You are, in many ways, like him, Dev.’ 

How?

‘You can both be pig-headed with your obsessions for one.’ 

This is true. What else? 

‘Stubborn.’

I am not stubborn. 

She raised her eye brow and grinned. ‘See?’

Point taken. 

The talking stopped as the size of each stair became bigger, the effort greater, the air thinner. There were also dog faeces on the staircase to contend with.  

Can we rest a minute? 

Dev’s lungs were heaving. ‘We need to hurry if you want to see the sunrise, Dev! Besides, we are almost there. You can rest well when we reach the temple.’ 

Dev craned his neck up. He could hear the faint toll of bells from the temple in the distance, but couldn’t see anything because there was light mist cloaking it. 

‘Come on, Dev. The sun is about to rise.’ 

###### Dev looked around but couldn’t see Ana. 

Where are you? 

A few steps above, he saw a shadow from beyond the mist’s veil. Puncturing the ghostly curtain, Ana ran towards him, her face a grimace. Dev looked stupidly on as she got closer. Finally, she grabbed his arm and turned back towards the temple again. ‘Run, now!’ Ana made Dev run the last twenty stairs up to the temple. When they reached the summit, Dev fell to his feet, exhausted and panting heavily. Ana refused to let him be: ‘Stand up, Dev. Life is too short to miss this.’ She was right. Dev forgot the pain in his thighs and feet as he sighted the first ray of sunlight shoot out of the horizon.  The night black was replaced by a blue that itself was morphing into an orange. ‘What do you think? It is like someone lit a giant matchstick in the horizon, isn’t it?’ 

This place is quieter than a library. 

‘You are hopeless, Dev.’ 	

Hopelessly in love with you, Ana. 

The sun was now above the horizon. ‘Come on,’ Ana said. She walked towards the temple’s western walls. ‘This will be as magical.’ Again, she was right. Thousands of feet below the mountain’s western slopes, its shadow, a perfect triangle, crept along the carpet-like valley below. As the sun continued to ascend, the shadow stretched towards the furthest limits of Mirage. Like a giant arrowhead, the shadow pointed towards the eastern [Check on orientation. ][][][Is this right? ]borders of Mirage. ‘Beyond those rivers, there is Circadia[Is this right?]. Beyond that, the rest of the world awaits. Someday, Dev, I am going to see it all with my own eyes.’ 

That sounds like an obsession to me. 

She gave him a friendly punch. ‘So, aren’t you glad I dragged you out of the library now?’ 

‘But this is the greatest library in all of Mirage.’ The voice came from behind and startled them. 

‘Hello.’ The gauntly monk smiled, ‘I am sorry if I frightened you.’ There was a beatific quality of his presence that immediately put Dev and Ana at ease. 

‘Good morning, Brother’, Ana said recovering from the surprise. 

It was barely a minute since meeting him but Dev couldn’t remember anyone who had as ready a smile. ‘It is cold and you both look tired. Can I offer you hot tea?’ 

‘Thank you, brother[Brother not brother]. We’d love a cup of tea.’ 

‘I am sorry I have little to offer you in ways of food at the moment’, the monk said. 

‘That’s fine, Brother. We are not hungry.’ 

He led them to his corner, under the only tree at the summit. He already had company. Having their breakfasts were a dog, a cat, and a troupe of monkeys. Dev and Ana soon realized they were eating what meagre food the monk had for himself. Instead of chasing the offenders away, the monk patted the animals and let them continue eating.  He served the tea in two coconut shells. ‘What brings the two of you to the temple on such a day? The full moon isn’t due for another week and the temple priest isn’t here today.’ 

‘We are not here for the rituals, Brother’, Ana replied. ‘My friend Dev had never been here so I thought I’d show him the temple.’

‘Isn’t it beautiful here, Dev?’

It is, Brother. 

‘Tell me’, he said turning to Ana. ‘He is Dev. May I ask what your name is?’ 

‘Anaka, Brother.’

‘That’s a beautiful name. We name our girls Anaka too.’ 

‘You are a Circadian, yes?’  She realized his accent was familiar, but couldn’t place it. Now she knew for sure. 

‘I was born there’, the monk replied. 

‘How long have you been in Mirage, Brother?’ 

‘I entered through the forests three weeks back. I’d always heard of the magnificent Temple of Mirage on top of this mountain. I wanted to meditate here.’ 

You’ve been here alone all that while?

‘I came here as the head priest was locking up the temple.  He was going back to the valley until the next full moon. He invited me to stay here and meditate till then.’ 

You said that this was the greatest library in the world. What did you mean, Brother?

The question caught the monk by surprise. Ana reigned in a look of annoyance. ‘A library is a vessel of knowledge, is it not? But it asks us to rely on the minds of other men to attain this knowledge. After coming here, I’ve learnt that our own minds are in themselves one of the largest vessels of knowledge of the cosmos and our place in it, most of that knowledge is hidden too deep in our consciousness for us to attain. I have not attained that knowledge but I will – or I will die seeking it.’ 

Ana was done with her tea. Dev had barely drunk his. They said their farewells to the monk and prepared for their descent. The monk accompanied them to the stairs. ‘Thank you, my friends. Your company gave me great joy.’ 

‘Thank you for your hospitality, Brother’, Ana said and began her walk down. 

We don’t know your name, Brother. 

The monk replied, his smile widening, ‘I am Gaudharma Brunhha. Have a safe journey, Dev.’ 

Thank you, Brother Gaudharma. 

Ana barely spoke a word to Dev on their way down the mountain. 



A sea of Miragians clapped, waved and shouted his campaign slogan, ‘A Brighter Future!’ as Jara Mahasen waved back at the crowd. This was his moment. This would be spoken about in decades to come as the beginning of the Mahasen era of modern Miragian politics. ‘Thank you!’ Jara’s voice echoed across the promenade through the public speakers. ‘Thank you. May Mother Mirage Bless Us All!’ The response was thunderous. If he listened hard enough, he could hear and separate the gruff voices of the men in the crowd from the excitement of the women; and they were all screaming his name. As he stepped down from the stairs of the Miragian State Assembly he saw a boy in the front row of the crowd pleading for Jara to come his way. He must be Dev’s age that boy Jara thought and made his way to the lad. ‘Please, President Mahasen. Please, sir. Photo please, sir’, he shouted over the din. Jara gestured his bodyguards to bring the boy towards him. Making his way over the railing, the guard motioned for the boy to spread his arms so that he may be body-checked, but the boy cut to the guard’s left, and before the latter could stop him, the boy, his face now cloaked in anger, ran up the stairs and towards Jara. It was too late to react. The boy jumped towards him. Jara thought he heard a click before the world cut to black. 

There was ringing in his ears. When he put his finger in to try and clear the irritation, he felt the warm ooze of blood. He opened his eyes. There was smoke billowing besides him. Above, the sky hadn’t changed from the bright sunny day he remembered from a few minutes back. Wouldn’t these everyday miracles transform into monstrous manifestations of death’s coming? Is the sky still blue for the dead?  He moved his fingers; they responded. He moved his toes; they too were still attached. I am conscious, so my head is still...Jara tried to get up. It was difficult: his torso was buried under three other bodies. I am alive. How am I still alive? One by one, with what little energy he had left, Jara pushed aside the bodies and forced himself up. Had the bodyguards managed to somehow cover him from the force of the explosion? Smoke was still smouldering around him. Jara scanned the surroundings, looking for other survivors. Nothing moved around him except for a murder of crows circling above the mass of bodies and blood.  How am I still alive and everyone else dead?

One crow swooped down towards where the railings had stood a few minutes before. Jara eyed the errant bird, a voice in his head telling him what it was about to do. And the crow did exactly that: it hopped towards a body and pecked at the corpse’s eyes. Horrified, Jara ran down the steps towards the bird, but by now the other crows too had started to descend into this morbid buffet. Each seemed to prefer the eyes of the corpses. Jara watched one bird fly away with an eyeball between its beaks.  ‘Help! Somebody, help!’ Jara shouted. ‘Someone please help me!’ 

Another bird landed on a corpse’s head, closer to Jara this time. The crow had its back turned from Jara. Time to time, it would bend down, peck at the eyes below its feet, and look up towards the horizon again[In the distance?]. Jara looked around: there was a pole at his feet. Picking it up, he swung at the unsuspecting bird. It had just bent towards the head to peck again when it felt the full brunt of Jara’s blow. Squawking in pain, the crow, unable to fly away, hobbled around in panic. Jara went after it, but then his brain recognized a familiar face in his peripheral vision. Jara turned to the corpse on which the crow had been feasting on. 

That face. It can’t be. No. 

The face, sans left eye-ball and bleeding from its mouth, sported a manic smile. No, No! This is not happening! Yara Mahasen’s face looked like he did the day he was butchered - as if that exact moment of his death had been captured by a master sculptor. ‘Remember, Jara: For a Brighter Future!’ Yara’s head cackled. ‘FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE!’ Jara closed his eyes as he felt the encroaching of madness, but the cries got louder still – ‘A BRIGHTER FUTURE!’ – like the volume of a PA speaker increased to unbearable levels. His curiosity getting the better of him, Jara opened his eyes. Around him were countless heads of Yara Mahasen, attached to the countless dead - men, women and children. They were all chorusing: ‘A BRIGHTER FUTURE!’  

‘Are you alright, Mr Mahasen?’ 

Ohiy was looking at him in concern. He looked around: he was in his room. 

‘It was just a dream’, Jara said gasping, his face soaked in panic sweat. 

‘Just a dream.’

‘Yes, you had a bad dream. Are you alright?’ 

‘I am. What time is it?’ 

‘It’s Six. You asked me to wake you up. Today is the big day. Your staff members are already downstairs. Your clothes for today are ready. I placed them on the divan.’ 

‘Thank you, Miss Ohiy’, Jara was starting to orient himself again. ‘I’m sorry if I frightened you.’ 

‘You did no such thing. Up now. You need to eat before you leave. Breakfast is ready as well.’

Jara got up from the bed as Ohiy was making her way out of the room. ‘Miss Ohiy?’ She stopped and turned back. 

‘Err...My sheets need changing. Can you ask the servants to be discreet –‘

‘I will take care of the sheets personally, Mr Mahasen.’

‘No! What? No. And stop calling me Mr Mahasen in private. I’ve told you – ‘

‘Jara’, Ohiy cut him off. ‘I’ve known you since the moment you came into this world. I held you in that prison hospital before your mother did. I’ve raised you and your three sons. This is not the time to be embarrassed.’ 

Jara was always left flabbergasted at her dedication to his family. ‘Thank you, Miss Ohiy.’ 

‘Get ready soon. Breakfast will be served in ten minutes. And Jara?’

‘Yes, Miss Ohiy.’ 

‘I hope you’ll pay a visit to your mother before you leave the house. She’ll like that. You’ve barely seen her in the last few months.’ 

‘Yes’, Jara agreed. ‘Yes, I will.’ 

​					

‘Good morning, Father’, Hasyl always stood when his father walked into the room. Manal had already served himself a plate and was eating. ‘Morning, Hasyl. Morning, Manal’, his tone changed between the two greetings betraying his views on his sons. Manal feigned politeness and mumbled the greeting back while chewing his food. ‘Where is Dev?’ His question was pointed towards Manal. Hasyl too looked in the direction of his older brother. Manal, still eating, took a while to register the eyes on him. ‘What?’ ‘Where is Dev?’ Jara repeated. ‘How’, Manal spoke slowly while munching a mouthful, ‘am I supposed to know the whereabouts of a seventeen year old? For all I know, he spends nights at the library.’ 

Ohiy walked in the midst of this tense exchange. ‘Can’t I leave you three in a room for five minutes and expect to come back to peace and quiet?’ ‘This is peace and quiet, Miss Ohiy’, Manal retorted. ‘Just an uneasy one.’ ‘Try harder at sounding a smartass, Manal. You’ll know when you do.’ ‘And how is that, Miss Ohiy?’ Manal was chuckling. ‘You’ll receive a thrashing from me at that point.’ The chuckling stopped. ‘Miss Ohiy, where is Dev?’ Jara interrupted. ‘He isn’t trying to miss today’s ceremony, is he?’ Ohiy motioned everyone to take their seats. She took her place at the table. ‘Dev is at Ana’s place.’ ‘Miss Ohiy’, Jara started. ‘He will be there at the ceremony. He promised’, Ohiy reassured him. ‘She’s leaving today, that girl.’ The breakfast was otherwise uneventful and completely devoid of conversation. When he was done, Jara’s secretary entered. ‘Sir, it is time.’ Jara stood and looked at the table. ‘I will see you all at the assembly today. Be on time.’ Hasyl stood and saluted, ‘Good luck, father.’ 

‘Can I bring a camera?’ 

‘What?’ Jara snarled. 

‘I asked if it was okay to bring my camera? I’d like to photograph it. Not every day –‘

‘How are you this naive?’ Jara asked. ‘How? How, Manal?’ Tell me: what would it look when I am taking the oath and my eldest son is clicking photographs like a member of the media.’ 

‘How do you manage to make that sound like a horrible thing?’

‘Enough! Enough. I will see you at the assembly with your brothers, your grandmother and Miss Ohiy. I will see you in the front row. I will see you dressed well and clean-shaven, like the son of a president ought to be. I will see you smile and be polite to all those important people who will sit around you. And, above all, I won’t – and let me repeat this so it goes through your thick skull – I won’t see you carrying a camera. Is that clear?’ Manal nodded. Jara stormed out. Hasyl was brooding by the table. 

‘Did you have to?’ 

‘Did I have to what?’ Manal asked. 

‘Did you have to make it difficult for him today?’ 
‘Hold on there, Captain Mirage, I was just asking –‘ Hasyl strode closer to Manal then, cutting the latter off mid-sentence. ‘You will go about today exactly as father said you will’, he rasped. ‘Do you understand me?’ 

‘Or else? Or else what, Hasyl?’ he realized then he no longer had any physical advantage over his younger brother. ‘You think that fucking uniform allows you to say whatever the fuck you want?’

‘Stop it! Both of you’, Ohiy voice was as assertive as it was when the Mahasen men were boys. Even now it commanded respect. ‘This is disgraceful! Have you any idea how many strangers are inside this house right now? Do you? What would they think? Hasyl, you are to go with your father’s entourage, yes?’ Hasyl, eyes still on Manal, nodded his head. ‘Then leave.’ Hasyl walked backwards, a cold smile stretched across his face, and eyes still on Manal. 

‘Fuck you, you pissant’, Manal shouted as Hasyl finally turned and left the room. 

‘Manal’, Ohiy’s voice was now terse, ‘If you don’t shut it, I will give you a thrashing. I don’t care how old you are, but Mother Mirage help me for I will give you a thrashing you won’t forget.’ 

‘Miss Ohiy, you saw what –‘ 

‘I don’t care! Find your brother. Bring him back here’, she started to clear the table. ‘And shower! Don’t think I don’t know what you do in your room all day.’ 

					*

Rejog’s condition worsened in the weeks leading to Jara’s election triumph. Ana and her mother divided their time in taking care of the old man’s needs. Dev was in class one afternoon when he received an urgent message from Ana: ‘Grandpa is asking for you. Pls come soon.’ Rushing to the Ziromt residence, Dev found Ana and her mother, Tysa, anxious outside Rejog’s room. ‘He’s been asking for you all day’, Ana said before she opened the door to Rejog’s room. ‘Try to sound normal. He’ll snap if he hears any sympathy.’ Dev closed the door behind and stood near it for a while. Rejog had thinned considerably. His breathing was raspy. Most of the curtains were drawn, but sunlight crept through a narrow opening and was bathing the left side of his face. 

‘Who is it?’ Rejog’s voice, though strained, reminded him of that moment almost a decade ago when Dev had walked into the old man’s office. 

It’s me, Rejog.

‘Sit beside me.’ Dev pulled a chair and sat by the bedside. ‘Where are you?’ 

Here, Rejog. I am right here. 

Dev placed his hand on Rejog’s. The old man held it. ‘Thank you for coming, Dev. I am sorry if you had to miss class on my account.’ 

That’s alright, Rejog. I’d rather be here with you. 

‘Thank you, my boy. You are probably wondering why I was so impatient to see you.’ 

Yes, I am. What can I do for you, Rejog?

‘I want to tell you a story, Dev.’ 

I like stories. You know that. 

‘You know I knew your grandfather?’ 

Yes, that was the first thing you ever told me, Rejog. 

‘Yara was not a best friend - he was like my brother. It is only right that I tell you what I should have told him, what I was too ashamed to tell him. But I will die soon and my only concern is that I don’t have this burden on mind when my time comes.’ Dev tightened his fingers around the old man’s hands. 

I am listening, Rejog.  

‘I was in love with your grandmother, Dev. I am still in love with Ella.’ He paused, giving Dev a moment to let the jolt soak in. If he was surprised, Dev didn’t let his hands betray it. Rejog continued, ‘I fell in love with your grandmother the day Yara introduced me to her as his future wife. I tried to ignore that first moment when I lost myself in her eyes, I tried to put it to the back of my mind, bury it like the cancer that it was. I should have been happy for Yara. Instead, I drunk myself silly and entered the greatest brothel in all of Mirage and didn’t leave for two days – until I was sure I had exorcised that first memory of Ella. They got married. And then he got into trouble because of those protests. Nothing, Dev, nothing has angered me more in life than seeing them treat Yara and Ella like that. The police, those scum beat them like animals. Like animals, Dev. I knew Yara was prepared for this, but Ella – she was only a teenager then. I tried to get them out. I tried, Dev. I tried everything, but the government wouldn’t do anything until the uprising of the working-class was quelled. On the day they were to be set free, I drove to the prisons to pick them up. First to Yara and then to Ella. I was so happy to see Yara again. We were waiting for an hour outside the women’s prison when the doors finally opened. And there she was. Your grandmother bearing a child. Prison ruins the spirit, Dev. I’ve seen it. My father spent a year in prison and when he came back, we barely recognized him. Not, Ella’s spirit. Not your grandmother’s. She now had the maternal glow. I realized before we all got into the car that I had never stopped loving Ella, that I had been in denial all along. Everyday thereafter was a battle between the demons of my heart and cold logic of my mind. Little by little, as Yara became more and more powerful a politician, I stopped visiting them. It was, in my mind, the only course of action. Even with hindsight, I do not think I would do anything differently. I loved your grandfather, Dev, but I loved Ella more. Instead of choosing one or the other, I deprived myself of both. Your grandfather thought I stopped talking and associating with him because of his politics. “You rich prick!”, he shouted on the day he finally confronted me about my distancing myself from him. “You rich boys, you sit back and there is money being made in your name, enough wealth to last generations. But here I am trying to come up, change my destiny, change Mirage’s destiny so that people from my background don’t have to suffer as I did - and you won’t have it, Rejog! You are an envious, rich cunt who doesn’t want to show other envious, rich cunts that you have anything to do with a dirty low-born commoner like me!” He stormed off. I did nothing to stop him. We never spoke again.’  Rejog was weeping. Dev wiped the Rejog’s tears away. 

Would you like to talk to my grandmother?

‘I see her in my dreams every night, Dev. I got married, had a daughter, a granddaughter who is the shining beacon of all the joy in my life, but every night Ella haunts my dreams. She haunts me to this day. She was the unattainable one. Ella. Ella. Ella’, tears continued to pour down. ‘My dying wish, Dev, is that I tell her the one thing I know to be true ever since the day I met her.’ 

Stop crying. Please. I’ll bring aach to you. 

Ana and Tysa were waiting outside the room when Dev finally walked out. He sat them down and repeated what Rejog had told him. They greeted the news with surprising ease. ‘I’ve always known there was someone else he longed for’, Tysa said when Dev was done. ‘Reading his work when I was an adult, it is fairly obvious none of it was inspired by mother.’  

Dev rushed back home. He knew the only way he could get his grandmother to travel was to let Ohiy arrange the whole thing. His first task was then to convince Ohiy. When Ohiy recovered from Dev’s telling of the story, she beckoned the nurse and told her what needed to be done. With the nurse’s help, Ohiy bathed and dressed Ella. Within the hour, Ohiy, Ella and the nurse were in the family car being driven to Ana’s home. Throughout Ella was particularly cooperative though she had no idea where she was being taken.  It was at the Ziromt hall that Ella froze. Her attention was grabbed by a photograph. No one said a word as they saw the Mahasen matriarch grapple with her memory, coaxing it to remember the faces in the photo. Dev stepped closer to her. 

That’s you and paataach on the right.

‘Yes, it is.’ 

He looks very handsome, aach.

She giggled, almost girl-like. ‘But this man...I know him too.’ 

Yes, you do. That’s – 

‘- that’s Rejog!’ she exclaimed, glowing in the aftermath of having won this battle with her fading memory. 

Would you like to see him? 

‘Yes! It’s been years since I saw Rejog. He hardly visits anymore[Barely comes to visit? Or he barely visits. ].’ 

Dev guided Ella into Rejog’s room. The old man was lying down exactly as Dev had left him, but there was a thin, dusty manuscript left unopened by his bed table now.  ‘Ella?’ Rejog’s voice sounded different to when Dev had heard earlier in the afternoon. ‘Rejog, is that really you?’ 

‘Yes it’s me. It’s Rejog. Come here, Ella.’ 

Dev led Ella to the seat and sat her down. Ana, meanwhile, adjusting Rejog’s blanket asked if he needed anything else: ‘Yes. Leave us.’ No one was prepared for this. ‘Now’, Rejog’s voice was more insistent.  Ohiy nodded her head to Dev, Tysa beckoned Ana; they closed the door lightly. 
Hours went by. From time to time, Ohiy or Tysa would open the door, taking care to not make a sound, and peep their heads in to ensure the Rejog and Ella were okay. Ana peeped in at one time and returned to the rest of the party sporting a smile on her face: ‘I heard laughter - from both of them.’ It was late around dinner time when Rejog called for Tysa.  As Ohiy and Dev went by Ella’s sides to help her up, she laid her hands on Rejog’s chest. Finding the hand, he lifted it to his face and kissed it. ‘Stay for a minute, Dev’, Rejog said as the party dispersed. ‘I need to give you something.’ When the room was empty again, Rejog motioned towards the dusty manuscript that was on his bed table. ‘That, Dev’, Rejog began, ‘is everything I wrote for Ella when I fell in love with your grandmother. Writing it was the only reason I didn’t descend into madness. I want you to have it. It’s yours now.’ 

‘And, Dev?’ He was at the door and turned back to Rejog. ‘Give her time. Ana doesn’t like cages. You do. Give her time and she’ll come around. Not now.’ Dev opened the manuscript on his way back home. It was titled ‘The Ghost Orchid: An Anthology of Poems for The Unattainable One’.

​						

It was dawn and Dev was reading Rejog’s The Ghost Orchid when he heard the news: the old man had passed away peacefully during the night. Ana was inconsolable. Dev tried his best to see her in the two days leading to the funeral but to no avail. ‘I am sorry, Dev’, Tysa said seeing the hurt in the boy’s eyes: ‘Give her time. She was very fond of her grandfather.’ 

The funeral was attended by over 20,000 people. Politicians, scientists, artists and writers paid their last respects <to a man The Miragian newspaper called ‘...the most influential voice in Mirage’s education system in the last three decades.’>. Dev’s family too paid their respects. Ella had already forgotten the man who had, less than a week ago, confessed to being in love with her almost all his adult life. As far as Jara was concerned, he was doing what was expected of a Miragian statesman and its future President; he knew nothing of his parents’ history with Rejog. 

Ana was by her mother’s side as the funeral pyre began to slowly crumble from the furnace within its body. When it was dusk and the pyre had done its work, Ana finally turned to Dev and spoke to him. ‘Come home with me, Dev. I have something for you.’ Ana led Dev to Rejog’s room. On his bed was a box full of books. ‘He wanted you to have all of this as well’, Ana pointed and said. 

I can’t, Ana. All of this is rightfully yours. 

‘My grandfather knew me better than you do, don’t forget that. He told me a few nights before he died that this box should reach you. In it, are his favourite books. They are all for you.’ Dev was astonished. He wasn’t prepared for this at all. 

Alright, I’ll keep them carefully. If you ever change your mind, Ana – 

‘- I won’t, believe me. I have no use for them.’ She noticed that her tone had hurt him. ‘I am sorry, Dev. I was preparing myself for his death, but not well enough it looks like.’

What are you going to do? 

‘I want to go to the countryside for a few days - that is what I want to do. Come with me.’ 

They spent a week at the country home. Ana was keen on hiking and most of their days were spent visiting the same places. Mirage Peak was crowded this time as the full moon was two days prior. The Circadian monk Gaudharma was nowhere to be seen much to Dev’s disappointment. Ana made no mention of him. They were serving dinner later that evening when Ana exclaimed, ‘I know what we can do. Stay right here, Dev! Give me a few minutes’, and ran outside, leaving her barely-served plate. ‘You keep eating!’, she shouted on her way out, ‘I’ll be right back.’ Ana was prone to moments of proclamations. She gave the impression that it was impulsiveness, but Dev had learnt over the years that it wasn’t really the case: she’d planned it all along, worked out the likelihood of her mad plans succeeding, and only then would she announce it to Dev when he least expected it. This was no different. What has she cooked up this time?

He finished dinner and cleared the plates waiting for her to return. Ana shouted from outside the hall, ‘Don’t come out yet! Stay right where you are.’  Dev walked around the dining room, examining the family photographs. There was Rejog and his wife, Ana’s parents as newly-weds and them as new parents, holding the infant Ana in their hands. There was one of Anaka from school, much older, closer to Dev’s first memory of her from the afternoon in the library all those years ago. Below it, a caption: ‘ANAKA-ODONATA ZIROMT, Outstanding Student, Form V’. Her face was more freckled then, auburn hair tied back in a pony-tail, unsmiling. 

‘Okay, Dev!’ she had her hands in the air, ‘I have a surprise. Follow me.’ 

What madness have you planned this time, Anaka-Odonata?

She stopped, turned around and laughed. ‘Now how did you come to know my middle name then, Master Mahasen?’ 

School photograph. You are looking very friendly.

‘Ha! My teachers couldn’t get me to smile no matter what. The cameraman was the rudest idiot.’

She was leading him down the hall and to the front door. ‘Now’, she turned back to him again, ‘close your eyes. Come on.’ Dev did. She held him by his hands and led him outside. ‘Alright, open your eyes now.’ Anaka had laid cushions on the flat rock that stood in the centre of the garden. ‘I want to spend the night watching the stars with you.’  It was a clear night, not a cloud in the sky and the light of stars illuminated everything around them. Neither spoke for a long time. 

Odonata is an interesting name. 

Dev’s comical interjection into the complete silence of the night made Ana laugh. She pointed at the five-starred constellation and related the mythology it had inspired among Circadians, and how that in turn had inspired Rejog to suggest Odonata as Ana’s middle name. 

I can’t believe you’ve never told me your middle name before - and it is a beautiful name, Anaka-Odonata. 

Dev found himself lost in her again. Ten years had passed since he first met Anaka and her eccentric grandfather in an empty library. Ten years and it seemed everyday he found new reasons to go weak in her presence – and new ways of not being able to tell her the one truth. 

He kissed her, starting with her forehead, then her eyes and finally her lips. Ana didn’t resist but pushed him gently back after their lips touched. ‘Why did it take you this long?’ There was resignation in her voice. Rejog’s last words to him echoed in Dev’s head then.

I wasn’t sure. 

‘Sure of what exactly?’  

I wasn’t sure if you felt the same. 

‘How are you now sure I feel the same?’ There was whiplash in the question. 

I am not, Ana. I am not. This moment felt right. 

‘Right now?’ 

Yes. 

‘Felt right?’ 

Yes. 

Ana drew in her breadth. ‘I’ve waited for you to tell me for so long, Dev. So fucking long. And it isn’t like you didn’t have the opportunity. We’ve spent days together! And yet you never said a word.’

Ana, I am sorry I wasn’t – 

‘- I am not done yet. Don’t interrupt me’, she was struggling to ensure her voice was neutral. ‘You remember the first time we climbed Mirage Peak?’ 

Yes. 

‘All it took was some hermit’s insane ramblings for you to completely forget me.’ 

Ana it isn’t – 

‘ - Stop fucking interrupting! I realized on our way the mountain that day that the only people you could relate to are the hermits and people like my grandfather. And you are not going to change. I know this.’ 

That is not true. 

‘Really? Dev, are you joking when you say you want to live on the moon?’ 

No, but that won’t happen. The chances of me – look, Ana only 30 men have ever walked the moon! – no one has lived there yet. It might happen in my lifetime, but me? It is just a foolish dream – 

She sighed, ‘How naive are you, Dev? You want to know everything about everything but you don’t know yourself. You forget I saw your face when that hermit said that bullshit about the temple being the greatest library in the world.’ 

I am sorry, Ana. 

‘Don’t apologize. Don’t you ever apologize for being who you are. Inside you there is a voice that constantly asks you to seek solitude. Inside of me there is a voice that is constantly asking me to see new things, meet new people.’ 

What are you saying?

‘I am leaving Mirage, Dev. You want to live on another world. I want to see all of this world, I want to travel to every corner of Pangaea.’ Dev hoped that the intensity of his beating heart and the quickness of his breathing was not noticeable. ‘Now that grandpa is dead, I have no reason to stay here.’ 

Aren’t I a reason? 

‘You are a reason to come back, Dev - If you are here at all -’

-I’ll be here. I’ll wait.  I only want to make you happy.

She ignored the interruption this time. ‘- But you aren’t a reason to stay. I am leaving for Circadia next week with my parents. Next week you become the youngest son of the youngest President in Miragian history. Next week my father will show my mother and I off to the diplomatic community in Circadia.’ Pause: ‘Next week our lives will change. But tonight, Dev Mahasen’, the smile returned again and Dev felt something deep inside of him leap up in joy at the sight of her smiling face – and that very thing then imploded. ‘Tonight, we have the stars, you and I.’ 

We do. 

Later that night Dev and Ana watched a spectacular meteor shower above them. When it was done, Ana, her head resting on Dev’s chest, turned to him, ‘I am sleepy. You?’ 

Not yet, but it is getting colder. We should go in.

 She was at the entrance to her room when she turned back. ‘What are you going to do?’ 

I’ll write for a while. I can’t sleep now. 

‘Can I watch you write until I fall asleep?’

Or can I write while I watch you sleep, Ana? Sure, you can. I’d love the company. 

‘Writers don’t like company, Dev. You should know that by now’, she chided him.  

Dev tucked Ana in bed and made his way to the writing table near the window. ‘What are you writing and when am I going to read any of it?’ 

A poem. One day I’ll let you read all of my writing.  

‘What’s the poem called?’ 

The One Truth. 

‘”The One Truth”, eh? The one truth, Master Mahasen, is that there is a world outside those pages you spend every waking hour poring over, the one truth is that you need to get out more – before you live on the moon!’, she teased. ‘I don’t know what you are going to do without me.’ With no clever retort, Dev managed to smile stupidly in response. Neither do I, Ana. Neither do I. He spent the rest of the night watching her sleep while adding more lines to the poem <The One Truth was promising to be a lengthy affair even at this early, work-in-progress stage>. 

​					 

 ‘Manal, where is your brother? I asked you to bring him’, Ohiy’s voice was threatening even when she whispered. The Miragian State Assembly was bathed in sunshine. Dignitaries from all walks of life were gathered to watch Jara Mahasen sworn in as the fifteenth President of the United Tribes of Mirage. 

‘I couldn’t find him, Miss Ohiy.’

‘What do you mean you couldn’t find him? He’s at Ana’s house.’ 

‘He was, Miss Ohiy’, Manal said. ‘He decided to go with her to the airport.’ 

Ohiy shook her head, ‘Stupid child. Stupid, stupid boy.’ 

​					

 In the days leading up to her departure, Dev and Ana spent whatever time they could with one another. Often, they spent it in complete silence; Dev because he was afraid opening his mouth would cause a torrent of words proclaiming his love for Ana while she feared anything she said now would irrevocably hurt him.  It was a strange week, but one they had enacted before when they met first as children. Even then his shyness had made it difficult for Ana to get through to him. The night before she was to leave, before Jara was to be sworn in as President, Ana and Dev walked the corridors of the library together for the last time. Everything smelled of Rejog. <Or did Rejog smell like old books?> Ana even remembered the game of hide-and-seek they had played in the giant library when they were children. After much goading, Dev agreed and they played their last game. She hid, rather obviously, in Rejog’s old office. Still, Dev wouldn’t have found her if it wasn’t for the sobbing echoing around the hallways. 

‘I miss him, Dev. I miss him every day.’ 	

I miss him too. He was very proud of you, Ana. You were the joy in his life.

You are the only joy in mine. 

She pulled him closer. The dusty floor creaked as they fumbled taking each other’s clothes off - like it was laughing at their comic cluelessness with the mechanics of foreplay. The love-making was hurried, both bodies unfamiliar with rhythm or tempo, both minds unable to reconcile ideas with action. Dev was lost in the sweet odour of Anaka’s neck and breasts. You are a Goddess, he whispered into her ears as Anaka’s breathing became louder and embrace tighter, plunging him deeper into her so that Dev could lose himself in her like she knew he had wanted to ever since they passed the awkward first years of puberty. They fell asleep on the floor with nothing to protect them from the dust and insects except for their coital sweat and tears. 

The next morning, they rushed to the Ziromt home that was on the verge of mild panic. At her gate, Ana turned back and faced Dev. ‘So, this is goodbye then?’ 

No. 

‘What?’ 

I mean – let me see you off at the airport. 

‘Master Mahasen, have you completely lost it? Your father is due to be sworn in today. You have to be there.’ 

I can watch the swearing in ceremony from any vision screen at the airport. I’d rather see you off. 

‘Dev, you do realize your father will become my father’s boss by day’s end, right? And my father won’t agree –‘

-He doesn’t have to know. I’ll get to the airport before you do. 

‘You are dusty, dirty and quite possibly mad.’ 

Possibly explains why we are friends, doesn’t it? 

‘Possibly’, she grinned. ‘Are you sure? Your father won’t be pleased.’ 

Nothing I do will ever please him. It doesn’t matter, Ana. I’ll see you around 11 at the airport. 


The crows circled above as Jara scanned his surroundings. This was only the beginning. This was what his father yearned for but was cruelly deprived of it by cowards. No matter. In the grand scheme of things, the writing of the first chapters of the Mahasen legend had only been postponed, not prevented, from being committed to the pages of history. Jara would write the opening chapters. Hasyl will take my place thereafter, I am sure of it. His eyes sought his family. He picked out Ella from the VIP section. Dressed in all white, Ella looked radiant – and it was all thanks to the endless reservoir of energy and selfless dedication that Ohiy possessed. He tried locking eyes with his mother’s but hers was vacant. Her eyes might be open, but her mind was already wandering, where Jara had no clue. Ohiy sat by her side. Could she, Jara wondered, have ever imagined that she would go from inmate to now attending a Presidential swearing-in ceremony? Ohiy’s eyes met his. They smiled at one another. Thank you everything Jara tried saying to her with his eyes. She understood – she always did – and nodded. It was Ohiy who had the glow of maternal pride, not Ella. Hasyl was by his grandmother’s side on her left. Dressed in military uniform, he looked much older than his 27. Above all, Hasyl looked ready to play his part. To Ohiy’s right was Manal. He was feigning interest, but Jara had to admit: Manal had, for once, followed his every command in dressing for the occasion. But wait. Where is Dev? Jara’s eyes scanned the row his family was sitting in. Where is Dev?! 

The Trinity walked on stage. The ceremony was ready to begin. The Miragian flag was raised and its anthem sung. The air of optimism in the crowd was tangible: it seemed everyone belted the song out from the core of their beings. 

Where is Dev? Jara craned his neck as the flag rose. The cloudless sky was all blue except for the crows, those damn crows. The anthem was done. Everyone sat down. <The Trinity – Prophet Saman CCCLIII, Prophet Shiva CCCXL and Prophet CCCXLV in this case – represented the religious apex of Miragian society. Each Prophet was chosen according to a three-thousand-year tradition: the identification of boys born of Immaculate Conception, their education in the ancient ways of their tribe for years before the standing Prophet of the tribe died. That would be the time would for one of these boys, the wisest of the lot, to assume the role of Prophet for their tribes. Together, the Trinity had provided spiritual council to Mirage’s political leadership over the centuries since the founding of the nation.>   

The Trinity stood and approached the podium. Together, they sang the words of invocation to Mother Mirage: ‘Water. Wind. Soil. Fire. You manifest in all that was, all that is, and all that ever will be. You who, in your infinite bounty, hath bequeathed us this land, to you we pay homage, children to Mother.’ The Trinity made the sign of Mother Mirage <arms bent, fingers together and hands pointing skywards, palms turned inwards>: ‘In eternal servitude’, the Trinity said. The crowd repeated the phrase. 

‘We are here today’, Prophet Saman CCCLIII began, ‘to begin anew. Our nation – every Samanian, Shivaputra and Adamite among you – has spoken: Jara Mahasen will lead us into the next decade. He takes on a solemn responsibility, for the Presidency of Mirage is not merely a political responsibility as it may be with our neighbours, but a cosmic one. Jara Mahasen will today be the fifteenth President of our blessed nation. Over these two centuries, the role of Miragian President has been bestowed by the people of Mirage to a select few who have understood Mirage’s place as unique in this tapestry of nations that we call Pangaea. Jara Mahasen’, the Prophet turned to face him. ‘Please approach us.’ The Trinity stood at the centre of the stage. The Trinity placed their right palms on top of one another’s, Prophet Saman’s being the top-most; on this they carefully laid the Book of Mirage <considered to be the foundational document of the Miragian nation>, they then bent their left hand, brought the fingers together and pointed towards them towards the sky, with palms facing inwards. ‘Place your right hand on this book and repeat after us, Jara Mahasen.’ Jara quickly scanned his surroundings again. Above him the crows still fluttered. He placed his right hand on the Book and his left hand bent, palms facing him. 

‘I, Jara Mahasen’, the Trinity [Recited in union]began. 


Dev watched his father on the Vision Screen and felt nothing. He was at the airport. People had milled around him, eager to see the new President officially begin his duties. No one, evidently, had any idea that that new president’s youngest was amongst them at that very moment. ‘[Geo politics and domestic politics need to be alluded to. ]Right man for the job, that’s what I say. Almost voted for his father, but then those bastards murdered him.’ ‘Ay, time to bring some equality into this country – and tell outsiders to mind their own business.’ 

More voices agreed with the first two. Someone clapped as the Trinity’s invocation of Mother Mirage was over. Dev felt a hand on his shoulder. ‘I hope we didn’t keep you waiting.’ 

‘Your father looks very happy’, she whispered to his ear. Ana looked resplendent.

Well this is what grandfather and he have wanted all their lives. Now he has it.  

The oath was about to begin. The crowd got heavier. Dev took Ana by the hand and walked away from the crowd. ‘You must be proud of your father, Dev.’

Ana, can we not talk about my father now? Please?

‘Alright, I am sorry.’ 

Do your parents know I am here?

‘Mama does. We didn’t tell papa because he might panic.’ 

And what did your mother say?

‘Exactly what I said.’ 

The crowd in front of the vision screen was silent now as the Trinity called on Jara to approach them and take his oath. 


‘..and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United Tribes of Mirage.’ Jara immediately felt a great weight press against his head as the last words rolled out of his tongue.  This is happening. There is no turning back now. The crows were still above, but their numbers had dwindled. One perched atop the flagpole. Jara thought he heard clapping. He turned towards the crowd and indeed there was applause. People were standing and clapping. He waved and flashed the smile he had spent an entire month perfecting in front of the mirror. 


‘Well, there you go’, Ana turned towards Dev as the screen showed Jara waving to the crowds. The crowd at the airport too waved back at the screen, some clapped, some whistled. ‘It is done. Your life will change now.’

Not everything, Ana. Before I forget: I want you to have this. 

‘What’s this?’ Ana sized up the thick envelope. 

It’s the poem. 

‘You finished it?’ Ana was excited. 

Yes, but don’t read it now. Today is about you and not me. Open it if you ever feel lonely during your many travels.

‘So’, the mischievous grin appeared on her face, ‘What then is the “The One Truth”, Dev?’

You’ll see when you read it.  

From behind a voice called for Ana. It was Tysa. ‘Boarding call’, Ana explained. Dev’s eyes could no longer look at hers. 

Right. You best get going. 

‘I am going to miss you, Master Dev Mahasen.’

I am going to miss you too, Anaka-Odonata Ziromt. More than you will ever know. 

She leaned in and kissed him. 

‘I’ll write to you.’ 

I will too. 

‘Goodbye, Dev.’

Bye. I’ll wait for you, Ana. I promise. I hope you know that.  

Their eyes met again for a final time. She tried smiling with her eyes, but there was no mirth now. Only sadness. Dev felt the implosion within him again as she turned around and walked away. She waved at him one last time. He waved back. I’ll wait, Ana. I’ll wait.
