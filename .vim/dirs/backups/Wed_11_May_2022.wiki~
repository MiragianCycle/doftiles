===Karma Is a Bitch, History is A Demon ===
:KarmaIsABitchHistoryIsADemo:Short_stories: 

- Opening line idea 

  - It was a Sunday when the children took over. They weren't children of course; most of them were university students, but some were younger. The news called them 'shrill'. They'd finally had it. I don't blame them. In the 20 years that most of them have lived, they'd lived in a society that was as volatile as a circus with drunken performers. 
  
  
- Plot ideas:  
  - A horror story but for adults
  - Sri Lankan parenting is very condescending in general, but can reach dangerous levels when parents insist on having a say in their children's future, mostly through their education and choice of life partner
  - In the lead up to the day the children took over, there is a spate of suicides across Sri Lanka, as kids are being forced to prep for an important exam while the country is in flames to a mysterious social uprising
  - The psychological toll of seeing so many young lives choose suicide instead of disappointing their parents, drive their older brothers and sisters first to protest by openly blocking public roads and promenades and reading THE UNTAUGHT, a book of suppressed memories that adults had deemed only to be read by the Asgiriya Sanga. 
  - The university students being read these books out loud, through Public Speakers ensuring that everyone had to hear it
  - They read, sing and act out every story from THE UNTAUGHT, resulting in every Sri Lankan getting suppressed memories to come out to the surface
  - This eventually results in Sri Lankans being unable to talk about anything other than the darkest parts of their collective history
  - Eventually every social situation leads to uncomfortable conversations about genocide and power structures
  - Politicians become uncomfortably truth-tellers, in some cases incriminating themselves for war crimes
  - This is how the children take over
