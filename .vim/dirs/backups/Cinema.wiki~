1. I think I to remember to let the film breathe
2. The audio edits that I did today is more appropriate for the start
3. The new Act1 will be as follows:
    - Start off with the line about Pala's first memories being walking in the Sinharaja with his father
    - Connect that to walking to the jungle to meet the favourite uncle
    - Let him tell stories of the uncle - sleeping on his chest, the smell of the dumala, etc.,
    - Then about how ritual artists like his father and uncle approached their craft: not in a capitalist sense, but a cosmic responsibility to rid society of its ghosts. 
    - We use this opportunity to introduce Pala's father, and Pala introduces us to the Navandana peoples
    
    - Eventually they reach the house - how the land was gifted to them by the government, and brief history of how the parents weren't married
    - Maybe consider mentioning some of the stories of the land disputes?
    - Mom's recollection of the story of a missing Pala
    - From there, we join Pala talking about walking through the jungle to school
    - The river, its sound and the demons that lurk in the world
    - Lazerus uncle

- So I figured the rhythm of each act of the film. 


| Act 1                                | Act 2           | Music Video              | Act 3           |   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|---|
| Black Star - Mos Def and Talib Kwali | Nine Inch Nails | Rage Against the Machine | Hamilton Part I |   |
| Folk lore                            | Horror          | Swagger                  | Triumph         |   |

- Today's edit was the first time I felt confident
- I went with my instincts and chopped up the Lazerus uncle story to a traditional Sri Lankan song - it now sounds like some weird prog hip hop and I am all for it.
- There are two musical interludes, featuring highly stylized visuals. The first is Lazerus uncle, the second is a seague from Acts 2 to 3
- This is the idea for the second one: it sounds like RATM but with SL traditional musical instruments, and looks like Nirvana's SLTS

- The editing process could have been a lot more efficient, and I've come to learn and appreciate the need for an Assistant Editor whose task [[Editing_inbox|Editing_inbox]] is extreme organization, and indeed detective work when the need to track down missing material comes into the equation

- Murch's six rules of editing are:
    - Emotion
    - Story
    - Rhythm
    - Direction of the audience's sight
    - Bidemensional space of the screen
    - Tridimesional space of the action i.e. continuity 

- Murch also suggests a practical way to implement this through a series of jettisons of useless baggage. Here, he suggests the jettisoning begins bottom up. That is you first get rid of Tridimesional space, and then make your way up the list, with story and emotion being the two that you DON'T GET RID OF [^1]
