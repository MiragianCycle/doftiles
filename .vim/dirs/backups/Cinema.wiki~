1. I think I to remember to let the film breathe
2. The audio edits that I did today is more appropriate for the start
3. The new Act1 will be as follows:
    - Start off with the line about Pala's first memories being walking in the Sinharaja with his father
    - Connect that to walking to the jungle to meet the favourite uncle
    - Let him tell stories of the uncle - sleeping on his chest, the smell of the dumala, etc.,
    - Then about how ritual artists like his father and uncle approached their craft: not in a capitalist sense, but a cosmic responsibility to rid society of its ghosts. 
    - We use this opportunity to introduce Pala's father, and Pala introduces us to the Navandana peoples
    
    - Eventually they reach the house - how the land was gifted to them by the government, and brief history of how the parents weren't married
    - Maybe consider mentioning some of the stories of the land disputes?
    - Mom's recollection of the story of a missing Pala
    - From there, we join Pala talking about walking through the jungle to school
    - The river, its sound and the demons that lurk in the world
    - Lazerus uncle

:PalaDoc: 

- So I figured the rhythm of each act of the film. 


| Act 1                                | Act 2           | Music Video              | Act 3           |   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|---|
| Black Star - Mos Def and Talib Kwali | Nine Inch Nails | Rage Against the Machine | Hamilton Part I |   |
| Folk lore                            | Horror          | Swagger                  | Triumph         |   |

- Today's edit was the first time I felt confident
- I went with my instincts and chopped up the Lazerus uncle story to a traditional Sri Lankan song - it now sounds like some weird prog hip hop and I am all for it.
- There are two musical interludes, featuring highly stylized visuals. The first is Lazerus uncle, the second is a seague from Acts 2 to 3
- This is the idea for the second one: it sounds like RATM but with SL traditional musical instruments, and looks like Nirvana's SLTS

:PalaDoc:Editing: 

- The editing process could have been a lot more efficient, and I've come to learn and appreciate the need for an Assistant Editor whose task [[Editing_inbox|Editing_inbox]] is extreme organization, and indeed detective work when the need to track down missing material comes into the equation

:Editing: 

- Murch's six rules of editing are:
    - Emotion
    - Story
    - Rhythm
    - Direction of the audience's sight
    - Bidemensional space of the screen
    - Tridimesional space of the action i.e. continuity 

- Murch also suggests a practical way to implement this through a series of jettisons of useless baggage. Here, he suggests the jettisoning begins bottom up. That is you first get rid of Tridimesional space, and then make your way up the list, with story and emotion being the two that you DON'T GET RID OF [^1]

:PalaDoc: 

- Cutting PalaDoc with audio first
- Some interesting themes from interviews carried out on 17th and 18th April in Deniyaya (prior to the 18 Sanniya) where Pala talks of the following: 
  - The Tea Club where the idea of rest and relaxation, and sport was morphed into this deadly sport of killing children, Pala's classmates
  - Palegama, as the Pala's happy place 
    - Literally the first place in the world where he was referred to as an artist
    - The friendships he made there
    - Why he had to leave


==Wed May 25 11:16:01 PM +0530 2022==

:PalaDoc: 

- Vindhya suggested that we start Act3 of the film with this line: 'Our History Began with a curse when Kuveni married Wijeya'


==Fri Jun  3 08:23:27 PM +0530 2022==

- Pala's use of the word 'athithiya' (past) is interesting because he - intentionally or otherwise - because is making a distinction between personal memory and collective history - between the micro and macro

==Sun Jun  5 07:58:25 PM +0530 2022S==
:PalaDoc:MusicVideo:

- I am going to cut the 'music video' to Saul Williams' Explain My Heart
- The song - in length, tone, emotional register - is exactly what I want for a section that I think of, thematically at least, as 'Swagger'
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_vUmvAXaWc|Saul Williams - Explain My Heart]]
- The music video will have a story. This is as follows:  
  - Pala is going from Pallegama to Colombo, unsure of who he is - as a person, and as an artist - because the cosmic energy necessasry for him to become who he was meant to be, is 'locked', and requiring release
  - Priyanthi embodies this cosmic energy that is missing in Pala's life
  - A ritual is required to help release this energy
  - The music video will therefore cut between Pala's entrance into Colombo  - represented through highly stylized entrance via Colombo at its most Colombo: Pettah, specifically Main Street
  - The music video will have two purposes: 
    - As a narrative transition device that signals a shift in mood and emotional register to the audience
    - As a means of introducing Priyanthi to the audience
  - The video will start by bringing back the visual of Pala going through into the jungle
  - Cut to Priyanthi shown without revealing her face at the start of the ritua
  - Cut to Pala finally turning to the camera hailing us to come closer 
  - The ritual drummers
  - Cut to Priyanthi as the energy goes closer and closer to being imprisoned
  
==Tue Jun 14 11:02:25 PM +0530 2022==

- For :PalaDoc: I am jettisoning rules five and six, especially for the more abstract things.  
    - [X] Bidemensional space
    - [X] Tridimesional space

*Notes for Isuru*

1. The new 'music video' is 9:00 in length
2. The music video serves as a synthesis of our entire film
3. It is divided into three parts like the film as a whole 
   - Part 1: Folklore
   - Part 2: Horror
   - Part 3: Swagger
4. The music video follows a story
5. The story is this:  

This is a fight between Pala's heart and the demons of his mind. Part 1 of this story is the first 1:20 seconds of the video. Priyanthi, cloaked in white and seen from behind, symbolizes his heart. At the 1:20, a demon touches his heart, launching Pala, and us the audience, into the horror portion of this music video. The horror portion will focus on the _18 Sanniya_ aspect of the _Thovil_ we witnessed on the 19th March. Here, most of the demons will be represented via the different masks they wear, each symbolizing a demonic fear. 

At the 2:02 mark, we jump in time to a day time, and we reveal Priaynthi's face for the first time. As the _Atharaya_ sybolizing Pala's heart and soul, the initial portion shows the Priyanthi on the cusp of conquering the demons. She attempts to do so, the demons begin attacking the heart, sometimes violently, tearing apart the fortress the heart had built to safeugard Pala. At the height of this demonic attack, Pala's heart finds itself - we show this with Priyanthi's eyes looking up and then cutting to Pala in Pettah - this sequence shows Pala growing in confidence as he finds himself in the jungle that is Colombo. 

Meanwhile, the demons continue attacking the heart, but the heart now smiles in response. It is no longer afraid. The scars are no more. Confused and afraid, the demons begin to retreat, but collapse out of sheer exhaustion.

- I think I finally got Act 2 down to a pat today. The horror elements are almost there
- Some of the themes/threads from the opening act of the film finds itself recurring nicely, almost like verbal motifs, allowing to almost mimic Pala's story-telling which can come around belatedly
