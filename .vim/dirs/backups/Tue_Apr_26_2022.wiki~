- Key Concepts
 
- Historical context: 

  - John Wheeler - who popularized the term 'Black Hole' - proposed a new way to think of the universe
  - Wheeler speculated that bits of information — whether something is present or absent, up or down, 0 or 1 — could be the fundamental ingredients of reality. “Every physical quantity, every it, derives its ultimate significance from bits, binary yes-or-no indications,” he wrote in an [[https://philpapers.org/rec/WHEIPQ|essay]] envisioning an “it from bit” cosmos.
  - Physicists have wondered if Wheeler's thesis could be used to unlock the profound puzzle of quantum nature of gravity. 
  - Vijay Balasubramaniam is working on translating Wheeler's ideas into mathematics. 
   
- Quotes
 
1. "A playful polymath who is prone to leaping from physics to Proust in mid-conversation, Balasubramanian directs an entire second research group at Penn that details how the world’s physical features have sculpted the brain. In neuroscience, too, he has found that ideas of information and computation provide a natural language." 

2. "_Quantum mechanics has a property called unitarity which guarantees that at a microscopic level, information cannot be destroyed. But Stephen Hawking calculated that information is destroyed as a black hole evaporates — creating a paradox. You have a tension between gravity and quantum mechanics arising from the destruction of information__. 

We also know that the _entropy of a black hole, which is a measure of ignorance or lack of information, equals the black hole’s surface area. There’s clearly something going on linking area, entropy and information_. You can feel it, but you don’t know what it is, so people have been feeling around for what to say about it.

One thing we look at is how the structure of space in the volume of an [[AdS universe]] manifests on the boundary. For example, _what does it mean for you to be able to move an object from point A to point B inside the universe when space isn’t fundamental?_ 

There is now an argument that if two regions in the volume of space are connected, then in the “flat world” boundary, the corresponding variables are entangled quantumly. _That means they contain information about each other; measuring one tells you something about the other. It’s a very beautiful idea, and a specific realization of Wheeler’s it-from-bit notion: If these bits of quantum information were not connected through entanglement, then there’d be no space._".

3. "_Are you saying that our 3D universe might really be an optical illusion generated by entangled 1s and 0s in some flat land?_ 

It’s completely fair to think about that literally. But debate continues on how far you can take this idea."

4. "art of the difficulty is that you need some vocabulary for what you mean for space to emerge. From our perspective, space looks nice and smooth, right? We might say that A and B are connected in space if we can draw a smooth line between them. But now suppose I take a microscope and look at a tiny region. Up close, you have every reason to expect that space itself, like everything in quantum mechanics, is fluctuating like crazy, bouncing around and ripping apart. In that case, what does it even mean to say A is next to B?

We must be willing to open our minds to more subtle ideas of space, which is hard because our imaginations are closely tied to our daily experience as large animals. But if someone had told me 20 years ago that I could even talk about this at all, I’d have said there was no chance. Perhaps in another 20 years we’ll have an answer to your question." 

5. _"We can’t yet probe quantum gravity in experiments. How can you tell when your outlandish ideas are working when you’re unconstrained by experiments?
 
That’s the thing; the mathematical consistency of the laws of nature is a drastic constraint. I don’t think people appreciate just how many things you cannot do if you agree with a set of rules_. 

Sometimes progress in theoretical physics comes when you remove an assumption. If you derive a bunch of theories consistent with rules, and the theories don’t describe the phenomena you think they should, it’s perfectly fair for you to question the rules.

For example, last year some colleagues and I studied what would happen if you entangled two gravitating universes. Suppose the two universes are not connected; they’re disjoint. Einstein’s picture of space requires that disjoint universes be completely severed, with zero paths from A to B. But we modified that assumption. We said, let’s allow the wild fluctuations of quantum gravity to establish fleeting connections. That could make sense!

We found that this tweak makes a computation work. *An apparent information paradox can be avoided if you agree that the rules for computation in quantum gravity let disconnected universes become momentarily linked*."

6. [A information-first approach to physics] can " arrange the information they contain is like this library. Like the books, the black hole’s “microstates” consist of nearly random combinations of its microscopic pieces. Information is preserved, but it’s next to impossible to recover."

7. "I once wrote a paper called “The Library of Babel: On the Origin of Gravitational Thermodynamics.” The name was inspired by a short story of Jorge Luis Borges about a mysterious library filled with books that look like nonsense. Eventually a librarian realizes that this library contains all possible sequences of letters. Almost all sequences are basically random, but every once in a while, you have the true story of someone’s life." 

8. "You studied both physics and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Why the latter?

_I had begun to feel that the laws of nature as we write them down are fundamentally constrained by the thoughts we can think. A cat can’t understand calculus, and it’s not obvious that humans can understand everything either. I studied computer science because I wanted to understand the limits of the computer in my head._" 

9. "How did your alternative life as a neuroscientist get started?

As a postdoctoral student at Harvard, I did my main research in string theory, but I also moonlighted in biology labs. I’d spend evenings at my friend’s lab looking at his data and reading papers. I’d wormed my way out of all my high school biology courses, so I had a lot to learn.

Then I came to Penn and met Peter Sterling, a neuroscientist. He would ask me questions like, “Why does this circuit look like this?” or “Why does this neuron look like that?” These are excellent questions because form follows function in biology."

10. What are some of the forces you’ve identified that have sculpted the form of the brain?
_Neural information is very expensive. It costs a lot of power, so if you think about the theory of energy-efficient ways of encoding information, maybe that should tell you about the brain’s structure._

_For example, there are different pathways in the brain for processing light patches and dark patches, and the brain devotes more resources to dark spots. Why would it do that? We showed that if you look at the statistical structure of natural images, there are more dark spots than light spots. We developed a quantitative theory predicting how many light detectors and dark detectors you should have to maximize your visual information if you were to set up an artificial system on a fixed budget. And you pretty much end up spot on with what you see in animals._

11."Have you answered your question about the constraints of the computer in your head?

_My neuroscience research has given me insights into why the computer is organized the way it is, but I don’t think I’ve learned much about the limitations of the processes in my mind that let me do physics. I still have hope of getting there. I think those higher-level processes are repurposing more elementary things we need to do to survive. It’s far more important to eat than it is to do physics._"

12. "So do you feel like the cat trying to learn calculus? Is the entropy of disjoint universes pushing our cognitive limits?

_You would think that, but we keep finding more! There’s a genuine mystery about this. We’re just using simple mathematical theories, but we’re talking about whether space-time is put together in an emergent way by entanglement. It’s so removed from our daily experience that it’s preposterous we’re able to extrapolate so far._"

1. Reach out to Dr Balasubramaniam over email. Here's a draft:

Dear Dr Balasubramaniam, 

 As a novelist working in the intersection between speculative/science fiction and magic realism, I found myself very moved by your recent interview on Quanta Magazine. I found your call for people in STEM fields to engage with culture - through literature, music and art - to be inspiring. 
 
 I myself have a deep interest in the areas that you work in - to be precise, in theoretical physics - because keeping up with advances in this field, informs the world-building I have to employ in order to create my fictional world. 
 
 I am writing this in the hope that I can have 15 minutes of your time, at your choosing, to interview you as part of research for my second novel. 
 
 Allow me to explain. 
 
I've been working on an important character for my book. An oracular figure to the story's protaganist, this character is a computer scientist-cum-neuroscientist-theoretical phycist. When I conceptualized this character and his backstory, I wondererd if I was being unrealistic: could there possibly be a person who reaches expertise in these distinct academic disiciplines?

Turns out there is at least one such person: you. 

I am interested in talking to you about two areas in particular: 

1. The emotional/intellectual/psycological impetus that fueled your curiosity in these three disiciplines? This will help inform my character as I am interested in exploring his childhood obsessions a little further
2. Could you suggest any methods or resources that would help a layperson such as I comprehend your work, at least on the surface level? This will help inform the substance of my character's speech when describing his work. 
3. I've read that one of theoretical physics perennial endevours is to find a 'Theory of Everything', one that resolves the paradoxes between the cosmic and the quantum. I am curious to know what you see as your ultimate academic goal? Is there one? Is there a profound insight that you hope to gleam from the intersection of these fields of study? This will inform my character's motivations in his adult life. 
   
   I realize this is a lot to ask, and I just want to stress that none of this urgent. I'd understand if you don't have the time for any of this. 
   
   Regardless, I wanted to personally reach out and pass my best wishes. Your work sounds incredible and I hope to hear of your achievements for years to come. 
   
   Best Wishes
   
   Theena Kumaragurunathan
