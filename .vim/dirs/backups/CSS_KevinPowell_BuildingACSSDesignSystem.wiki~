==Creating a Design System with CSS ==

== Fri Oct 28 02:10:08 PM +0530 2022==


= THE DESIGN SYSTEM =
- The Project will be based on a project provided by FrontEnd Mentor
- We will appraoch this with 
   - Custom properties
   - Utility classes that will allow us to save time
       - Utility classes do one thing and do it well
       - Often have only one declaration (multiple are allowed, as long as multiple declarations are still doing one task)
       - Utility classes allow for modular design, and allow us to write less code in the long run
   - Don't stress too much over layout
