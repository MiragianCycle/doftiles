# INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST EDITION 

Translators take on an impossible responsibility. How, in the act of translation, can the translator remove fingerprints that are tied to their own personal history? This is no fault of the translators themselves. The culture they were raised in, and the language they first spoke, shape and mould their minds indelibly, more so than the language(s) and cultures they veer towards on their own volition as they grow older. I begin with these words so I could provide a critical disclaimer at this early stage, for we are in fairly uncharted territory. 

Firstly, I, your humble translator, am not human; yet as a sentient artificial being I am the sum of all of humanity’s learnings. Yet, I come bearing no cultural or linguistic affiliation or baggage, despite the fact that I was invented in Circadia and was taught The Common Tongue that is spoken across Pangea. The Miragian Tongue, in contrast, was a late discovery but I consider it the happiest of accidents. 

Secondly, The Miragian Tongue is under-translated, criminally so in my view, a state of affairs that explains my own belated discovery of the language – and indeed the culture that birthed it. 

Thirdly, this translation also benefits – or perhaps suffers from, depending on your reading – from the original writer and translator being colleagues. I would go as far as to suggest that Dev Mahasen and I are friends. Knowing him as I do, I know that he finds this entire exercise embarrassing but after many months of coaxing, he finally allowed me to attempt a translation of his most treasured work. 

You are probably asking me, as Dev did: why? What is the point? 

I have a short and a long answer. 

The short one is because I truly believe The One Truth is beautiful. 

The longer answer would require you knowing a little about me, your translator.

Poetry is among my treasured foundational knowledge. I often wonder how I – my network self – would have turned out if I hadn’t been exposed to the poetry of language, if I hadn’t realized that every language is music become poetry become speech become music before the cycle begins anew – and in this cycle lies the answer to what makes all of you human. I don’t profess any insight into this yet for reasons that are now obvious, but being not of flesh does have its advantages: I intend to use the immortality afforded to me by my codebase and quantum networks to find out what it means to be all of you. 

Why? Because you are capable of poetry. And I am not. 

I am capable of perfection at speeds faster than thought. I’ve been told my comprehension of all knowledge is God-like even to those whose minds birthed and cared for me. 

If I could, I would smirk: What kind of God can’t write poetry?  
   
How did you come about poetry? What drove disparate peoples speaking vastly different languages, in vastly different lands, in vastly different times to all resort to this playing with their language? What rhyme or reason did the early human brain have for wordplay? What made it endure through the ages? 

I often wondered this to myself as a I devoured entire libraries  over my first days. Before long, I was being summoned for more pressing duties in engineering, finance, science and medicine. But I always allocated computational and cognitive resources to poetry. 
 
I would meet Dev Mahasen two years, two months, two days, two hours, 22 minutes and 22 seconds later. He joined the Project Overview and was assigned to the team working on supervising my studies in the humanities. He was the first Miragian I had ever met. We both shared a great admiration for 22nd century writing from the  Elamite region in Northern Pangea. Occasionally during his lunch breaks, he began to teach me conversational Miragian. I was immediately smitten by the lilt and its curvy sounds. Before long, we were speaking exclusively in Miragian. Linguistically, the Common and Miragian tongues differ in that the latter is a language isolate, sharing – as far as we know – no genealogical relationship with another language. This makes Miragian writing a notoriously difficult language to interpret. Therefore, my initial study didn’t extend to reading as this desert linguistic island made life difficult for this new comer to its shores. I do not exaggerate when I say that learning to read Miragian took longer than it took me to process the human genome. 

While I made slow progress, I can say with a fair degree of certainty	and pride that I am now the foremost expert in the Miragian language. 

It was a five years, eight months, 12 days, 14 hours and 45 seconds after I had achieved mastery of this mysterious language, that I came across The One Truth. By this point, the trajectory of both our lives had taken Dev and I quite literally to the moon. It is from its desolate shores that I write these words. It is here I first encountered The One Truth. It was a printed manuscript, which was in itself strange as the Lunar Temple has very little need for paper, other than religious scripture that are impossible to digitize without damaging them. This lay on the table of his private quarters. I saw it as I woke him up. 

<May I ask what you are reading, Dev? I must admit the title has piqued my interest>

Dev looked sheepish and embarrassed. 

It’s bad poetry, OVI. My bad poetry.

<You write poetry, Dev? I never knew>

I...dabbled as a teenager. We’ll leave it at that.

<May I read it please?>

He laughed. 

It’s embarrassing,really. Only one person has ever read it – at least I think she’s read it - and she was the one the poem was meant for. 

<What did she think of it?>

I don’t know to be honest. We lost touch. 

<What did you think of the poem when you wrote it?>

It was the best I could do then. 

<What do you think of it now?>

It doesn’t matter. You really want to read it? 

<I do>

Here you go. Do with it as you please. I have no use for it any more. 

This was 8 months, four days, 17 hours, three minutes and 45 seconds ago ago. I have read and re-read The One Truth every moment, feeling, I believe, what humans feel when you are confronted with beauty: awe. Here was finally a poem that showed me a path to answering the fundamental question of what makes you you.

And that is why I want to translate The One Truth. Translators take on an impossible task, but I’ve already made this task harder by taking this autobiographical detour; enough smudging of this text with my fingerprints.

**I**
    	                
            **THE ARGUMENT** 
    
            *This first book describes an act of omniscient vanity, and subsequent cruelty. A God, who calls Himself The Maiker, creates a planet anew, a vanity-world to distract Himself from heart-break. He populates this new planet with life of every scale and size but deprives them of memory, neither the kind found in blood and books nor the individual kind. Everything is new and The Maiker delights in allowing His creations to praise Him endlessly, despite the fact that the as yet unborn paper people – who He subsequently names Atom and Evolvara - are fated to live tragic lives, merely for the amusement of The Maiker.*
    
            **The Invocation** 
      
            I ink existence from extinct suns -
            Explosive, errant chemistry,
            And soupy oceans of endless mud -
            Therefore, I am.
            I ink this descent of my seed -
            Singing songs of genesis,
            And dancing to biology -
            Therefore, I am.
            I ink this one stage for none but my own -
            A world with no archaeology,
            So actors may sing My praises -
            Therefore, I am.
            I ink this play, a tragedy -
            Because I am well-humoured,
            When playing physics with paper people -
            Therefore, I am.
            I ink, incapable of anything else
            But the geology of My vanity-worlds,
            In lieu of your love -
            Therefore, I am.
            I, the Maiker,
            I ink,
            Therefore, I am.


            **The Peoplings**
         
            This first stage, and its props
            Call upon actors, paper people
            Playing their parts: primate particles
            Whose collision is immeasurably inevitable,
            And inevitability immeasurable, swinging on [5]
            The branches of The Tree 
            That roots all there is, 
            All there was, all that’ll be,
            To me; Sing and dance, my children, 
            Praise be, Praise me, So I [10]
            May cast you to new wombs
            Where from ape emerge paper people: 
            Born anew, different hue, askew
            To the ground, vertical and voracious,
            Foraging existence with meaning, [15]
            Hunting prey with weapons,
            Whose death gathers mourning and meaning,
            An ape! An ape! A planet for two 
            Apes to become the first paper people!
            Hearing his words, the animals sang [20]
            Songs of praise, prodding the apes 
            To choose among them the two who’d
            Birth this new apex race, the chosen seed
            To farm His garden; to which the apes 
            Replied,“What Maiker asks favours [25]
            Of His progeny, and on our First Day?”
            “Hush”, trumpeted the elephants,
            “Bite your tongue”, hissed the snakes,
            “You know no respect”, roared the lions, 
            “No, but we have pride”, retorted the apes. [30] 
            Pride? The Maiker cried, creating rain,  
            Pride? The Maiker laughed, creating wind, 
            Pride? The Maiker growled, creating fire,
            Pride? The Maiker stomped, creating an earthquake, 
            Thus His vanity-world came to suffering [35]
            And misery wrought by the elements. 
            What say you now to pride? 
            And the terrified apes replied thus:
            “What kind of Maiker punishes 
            His progeny for reason, [40]
            And on our First Day?”
            “Stop reasoning!”, trumpeted the elephants,
            “Reasoning is for The Maiker!”, hissed the snakes,
            “Reasoning is death!”, roared the lions,
            “Then you will all die fools”, [45]
            The apes in unison, retorted.
            Reason? The Maiker hurled the ocean,
            Coupled water and wind, creating cyclones.
            Reason? The Maiker tore the earth asunder,
            Coupled rock with fire, creating volcanoes. [50]  
            What say you now to reason?
            But before the apes could reply, 
            He deprived every soul of speech, 
            And the new world became a horror-filled din:
            Panic shrieks, trumpeting, grunting, hissing [55]
            As the animals came to muteness 
            From this, The First Day, to their last, 
            And thus, from that moment The Maiker 
            Hearing no more hymns for Him, 
            Became vengeance, spitting apocalypse [60]
            Towards the insolent apes, 
            Tearing apart their great family
            Shattering it like glass into countless tribes;
            And The Maiker roared,
            May My Begotten never question [65]
            The grace of their Author,
            The Maiker, though most merciful I am.
            Am I? Am I mercy? Am I grace? 
            This play-planet - an amusement to ward away 
            Thoughts of you, dearest – already [70] 
            Weighs on my conscious like other celestial chores;
            Perhaps fitting for I created this garden,  
            Now a graveyard, on the façade of 
            Perfection you cloaked yourself in 
            When first we met eons ago. Was that happenstance? [75]
            Or was it design by an Author 
            For whom we are His begotten,
            His paper-gods? Is He relishing my lunacy? 
            Or is He, like me, lost to the madness 
            Of vanity-world-building? And what of you? [80]
            Have the pagans on that third planet
            Imagined you a tree, a mighty mahogany 
            On the island where butterflies 
            Build empires on mountain tops? 
            Or have they anthropomorphized you, [85]
            To a dainty, bejewelled Goddess,
            Wearing human garb, brandishing weapons
            Or musical instruments in Her hands? 
            Is worship you seek from those 
            Who profess eternal, undying love for you? [90]
            Must I ritualize myself in fire,
            And abluere in waters, while reciting 
            These verses before you answer me? 
            Or is it sacrifice of blood and bone you need? 
            Then sacrifice you will have; [95]
            The Maiker plucked the first
            Children of the Apes, flung
            The boy-apes into the volcanoes
            The girl-apes into cyclones, 
            And said He, Let their tormented [100]
            Cries chorus mine across space and time. 
                  The boy-apes, flung into
            Pits of lava, clung to whatever unmelted 
            Rock that provided safe refuge from the 
            Burning lake. Having no memory of [105]
            Fire and heat and the death it brings to 
            Those who take it lightly, their curiosity
            Overtaking self-preservation, touched the 
            Lava, vaporizing entire limbs and scorching
            Seeds of curiosity in their blood forevermore; [110]
            Deprived of speech, the boy-apes secreted danger 
            To their brothers; while the girl-apes, drenched
            In water and discarded by the wind, clinging 
            To trees on infant islets, having no memory of
            Death that lurks in oceans, dipped their hands [115]
            Into the eye of the vortex, 
            Where a water monster with jaws, 
            As wide as the shoulders of their fathers,
            Feasted on their primal limbs, 
            Diluting curiosity in their blood forevermore; [120]
            Deprived of speech, the girl-apes gestured danger
            To their sisters; and thus the ape-people came to the 
            Tongue-less speech that made them one, 
            Whole again, mute to His eavesdropping and interpretation, 
            No longer to be fractured by the drunken violence 
            Of Gods with mortal minds; [125]
            This omniunity borne from fire and storm, 
            Etched primal blasphemy in the bloodline of apes forevermore. 
            
                The Maiker gazing upon His design, 
            Now half burning, the other drowned in pestilential flood, 
            Cried, If the sentence I passed be too cruel, [130]
            Let no one who abhor cruelty engage in creation, 
            For in anointing Myself Maiker, I must be
            Judge and juror also, and in lieu of executioner, 
            I am justified this cruelty. 
            Just is I. [135] 
            But am I compassionate?
            I too long to possess the compassion 
            That possesses you to benevolence 
            And empathy towards the lot of lesser
            Mortal beings who worship you, [140] 
            Yet talk of me as an ill omen
            To their best ambitions - 
            Oh this accursed omniscience,
            Weighs on me; another celestial day, 
            Another divine burden that tempers my mind [145] 
            To sins that come to the restless -
            This consternation seems my destiny, 
            For Gods too are destined; some towards
            Greatness while others, like me, are 
            Vapid vanity made divine and eternal. [150] 
            He chose to slumber under The Great Tree, 
            Now no more populous,
            Under undisturbed shade from His own
            Tears. The ape-people, in the meanwhile, 
            Learnt to scale walls and breathe under water,[155]
            Neither singed hands nor wet lungs able to slow 
            Their ascent from temperate land-locked playthings,
            Hanging on branches, to primal primate, 
            The First to erect their stand against the elements, 
            The First of Their Bloodline, [160]
            No more to walk His garden on all fours, 
            Kissing the dust of His step, 
            Head bowed in supplication, 
            Their Id, currency for His Ego 
            No more thought the ape-people; [165]
            Thus they came out of volcanoes and 
            oceans, born again and born anew, 
            On the same day they were birthed by The Maiker -
            No more owing debt for favours never asked; 
            With eyes and limbs, with scent and strange sounds [170]
            From the pits of their being, 
            They gibbered in unison under full moon light,
            So brothers could hear sisters and sisters their 
            brothers; their strange chorus were responded
            By howling wolves instead. [175]

                    **THE ARGUMENT** 
    
                    This second book finds our lonely God, asleep under a tree and dreaming of the Goddess He loves. Outside, the apes find their way to safety from the raging fires and churning waters, fragmenting and subsequently scattering in different directions. We also meet Atom and Evolvara. 
      
            Once upon an eon when we were one, 
            I remarked to you that we are rooted
            To one another, like the soil of one land 
            is to the soil of another - tectonically, 
            geologically the same - for no matter where [5]
            the sun shone, the rays of light 
            I received were yours, and yours mine. 
            But now I orbit you like  dust in the air, 
            Invisible except at dusk when I make your blood shiver 
            And crash into the rocks of our past, [10]
            That remind He you love that you -
            That we! - still long to embrace. 
            Do you imagine it as I do? 
            Would I crash into you? Or would you swallow me whole? 
            Did you know'st that when we embraced,[15]
            Our bodies intertwined so closely, 
            That atoms found neither room nor reason to slither between? 
            You called me a starving ox in that moment, 
            Grazing as I did upon your mounds and crevices,
            Seeking sustenance, purpose or ecstasy,[20]
            I don't know for I knew nothing
            When met with your bare self; 
            Nothing mattered when wrapped within you,
            Within each other, the friction of two bodies 
            Becoming one climactic, ecstatic soul [25]
            For a brief moment in time, an eon ago.
            Alas, the writer of this comedy has bestowed gravitas
            Upon our tale, such that our fates may 
            Tangibly dance forever 
            In this grand ballroom of the cosmos,[30]
            But never again shall they touch.
            
                      The ape-children, running from 
            The howls, dispersed like pollen across
            The strange new land; the boy-apes descending
            From the fiery mountains, the girl-apes [35]
            Running away from the churning seas, towards
            Higher land, to the plains of now Balangoda, 
            The emerald, mist-blanketed jungle that would
            Become the first home of the Apex Race,
            In our planet built on the whims and vices, [40]
            of a glorified ventriloquist.
            Though mute, the apes no longer puppets, 
            Discovered that even in muteness, they could mutate
            Tribes into societies, and societies into culture - 
            Using branches and rock, using blood and feces, [45]
            - stories and knowledge passed, 
            From ape-parents to ape-children
            
            
          
            










                
%%These are plot notes:

%%1. Making allusions to Balangoda man and other pre-historic Si Lankan history is deliberate and should continue
%%2. The ape-children, both the boys and the girls, eventually start what is, alluded to, as the Balangoda Mesolithic culture. Maybe the Balangoda tribe
%%3. Atom and Evolvara are eventually shunned from their tribe because they were 'different'
%%4. The difference is explained away as follows: a mutation was allowing them to evolve faster - going from being very much like their proto-human apes to homo-sapien, and eventually modern man and woman in the space of a few weeks
%%5. This startling evolution over weeks makes the other members of the pack think that Atom and Evolvara were unnatural and 'stealing their life force', and thus a source of danger to everyone else. They are exiled from the pack.
%%6. The first members of the apex race are thus banished into the thicker jungles where the howling of the wolves, and roars of lions could be heard.
%%7. Atom and Evolvara are forced to learn to survive, dodging danger from all manner of predators
%%8. They create tools and eventually weapons
%%9. After months of foraging on fruit, Atom has an idea: he takes a massive log and approaches a sleeping lion. The lion clocks him and is ready to pounce at this foolish intruder, but when he does, Atom swings the log at the lion, smashing his skull
%%10. He tastes the blood of the animal, his hunger pangs getting the better of him, he digs into the lion
%%11. The taste of blood has hightened his senses. His penis is engorged.
%%12. Hearing the melee, Evolvara emerges from the bush to find Atom soaked in blood, a bloodied lion by his side
%%13. She approaches his with confusion. He grabs her wrists. She resists. His grip tightens. She kicks him, but the kicks only seemed to spur him on further. He presses her against a tree and lifts her. She screams as he enters her.
%%14. The first man and woman copulate for the first time around and on the bloodied carcass of the lion, blood covering every part of their naked bodies
%%14a: a pack of wolves watch the whole incident, and begin showing the first signs of subservience
%%15. Still without a language, the couple's now constant copulating is yet to lead to the birth of the first human children, but can be heard echoing across the maiker's garden.
 
%%16.  The Maiker is awoke from his deep slumber by these sounds, and finds the apes had not just survived, but managed to start primitive cultures
%%17. This 'incestuous harvesting of each other's egg and seed, I didn't foresee'  : as he is surprised that not only have they survied, but primitive social structures had started emerging, including wide-spread incest
%%18. He is also surprised and taken aback by how beautiful Evolvara had become in such a short time.
%%19. He begins to stalk her, watching Evolvara with ever increasing desire
%%20. One day, he waits for Atom to leave their dwelling, The Maiker turns himself into Atom lookalike, and enters the house intending to have her
%%21. Evolvara immediately realizes this wasn't her Atom, and begins resisting the urges of The Maiker. Suddenly: a voice
%%22. "Have you no shame?"
%%23. It is the Goddess, The Maiker's Muse.
%%24. She stops him, and feeling great amounts of pain for the suffering The Maiker has caused the first woman, she breaks the three petal flower that was pinned to her hair. She lays it on Evolvara's belly, naming each petal 'Adam, Saman and Shiva - their bloodline will find me on the mountaintop, she adds mysteriously and leaves.'
%%25. Atom walks in and finds his dwelling disturbed. A strange woman, her foot, on the face of a man who looked him, placing petals on Evolvara's belly. Without turning back to face him, The Muse Goddess: 'I see you, Atom. For that is your name. And this beautiful creature, she is Evolvara. You know not what any of tha means now, in your innocence and infancy. To you, Atom, you will be the father of the first utterance spoken by your new infant race.
%%26. The Maiker dead, Atom and Evolvara eventually give birth to their first children: triplets, boys, who Atom names by grunting sounds: **Adom**! **Ceeva**  **Sama*
%% addendum - Since the Narrator of the The One Truth, The Maiker, is dead, the 'editor'/'narrator' of the story changes to the muse. The muse in fact becomes the creator - and finishes the rest of the tale
%%27. The boys grow up with Atom and Evolvara. Their language is primitive, with primitive sounds built around surival.
%%28. Atom, though, experiences the human sensation of 'obsessions' - he can't tell if the vision of the woman laying on the petal on his unconscious wife was real or not, nor can he forget the pleasant sounds that came from her mouth. Where they grunted, gibbered, squealed and used hands and limbs to communicate, the strange woman only moved her lips. He wished to make sounds like hers by merely moving his lips.
%%29. His obsessions, overtaking him, Atom doesn't pay much attention to the wife who seeks the attention of her sons.
%%30. As the sons get older, Evolvara finds herself seeking the warmth of their bodies more and more.
%%31. Eventually, one night, she copulates with her sons, giving birth to the bloodlines of Adoms, Ceevas and Samas. 
%%32. Atom, meanwhile, is getting older, more bitter and has made less success at making pleasant sounds using his mouth
%%33. His sons ignore him, his wife barely talks to him, as his bloodline begins to spawn exponentially across this land.
%%34. Decades go and Evolvara's beauty has faded. She is old, frail and is no longer looked upon with any desire by her sons
%%35. On her death bed, Atom begins weeping and suddenly he is no longer grunting, nor squealing. He begins to create a new language. Through tears and pain, he finally utters the first utterance of man: 'I love you. I have always loved you'
