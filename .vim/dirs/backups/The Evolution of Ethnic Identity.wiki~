1. Initial impressions
   - Been wanting to read this book since Prof Piyasena at BCIS mentioned Professor Indrapala was a class-mate, and that he was chased out of the country for research that was contrary to LTTE narrative of a traditional homeland 
   - Reassuringly, and perhaps ironically, Indrapala cautions against using history as a means to justify nationalist rhetoric
   - 
2. Actionable takeaways
   - Definitely using this as a reference for The First Lankan  
   - There are hints of a language present in Sri Lanka that has no linguistic connections to either Aryan languages such as Sanskrit and Prathik (roots for Sinhala), and Dravidian languages such as Tamil
   - He also mentions how it is necessasry for us to consider Genetic research into the past, along with the cross disciplinary insights coming from [[linguistics]], [[Anthropology]], etc.,

7. Essay idea: *The History of Time and Time Again* - Or How Sri Lankans    Engage with the Past
    - Karl Jaspers and the need to always remember the past - said in the context of Nazi uprising, that it was necessasry to remember because on in remembering the minutae - the causes, symptomps, and the legacy of the Nazis - was it possible to ensure that this would never happen again
    -  Foundations of Modern society class where Piyasena brought up this story of 'his friend', the archaeologist Indrapala who had been 'chased out of Sri Lanka' by the LTTE for his research that had 'disproved the existence of a Jaffna Tamil kingdom'
    - How I was taught history over the years: Primary school was 'Sri Lankan History' while Jr Section was 'European and Western History' - no attempt was made to explain to us students why this jump in space and time
