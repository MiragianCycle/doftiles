* Miragian Mythology
** Sources
   The primary source of Miragian Mythology is /The Book of Mirage/, the foundational text upon which much of Miragian society is built. A quick summary of the myth, with selected quotes.
   /In the beginning, we lived a nomadic existence in an arid desert that had
   become our home, devoutly praying for 500 years so that our eyes may see
   the mythical Mirage, the Motherland that had been bequeathed by our First
   Ancestors – Saman, Shiva and Adam – to us, the Desert People./

** Common Tongue
   - How the Common Tongue became /Common/
     - Possible explanations from modern world history are *Colonialism* or *Trade*
     - If Colonialism, then is Konik the super power? 
     - If Trade, then what is the economic justification for a Common Tongue?
     - My justification: Konik is ridiculously big, and ridiculously resource-rich. This has created a unipolar balance of power in the world where Konik enjoys economic power with little need for showing of military strength or colonialism; it's power is /soft power/
     - This /soft power/ manifests in the form of cultural domination of the global zeitgeist: intellectual, artistic, commercial, scientific pursuits within Konik benefit the entire world (analagous to US research resulting in the internet and eventually the WWW)
     - In the cultural space, it is Konik entertainment - in music and performing arts - that dominate the world's movie theatres and radio stations
     - In the economic space, if any nation wanted to do business with Konik, they'd have to literally speak the language of the Konik
     - Thus the Common Tongue came to be through the combination of economic, scientific, and cultural domination on a planetary scale
     - Visualize Konik as a Frankenstein nation that combines China's size, Switzerland's outsized economic power, US' scientific and cultural leadership. 
     - The Common Tongue is, in reality, has a common root that has morphed into a rich sea of dialects, in the same vein as German and Swiss-German's linguistic ties.
