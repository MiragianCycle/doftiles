== The 'People's Revolution'

It has been a strange year. 

2022 began with an offer for me to make my first film, and now I find myself participating in my first protests.

These protests are unlike any I've ever seen in Colombo or the country. Protests and protestors sometimes live in their own bubbles, not necessarily outside the mainstream Sri Lankan society, but rarely do all walks of Sri Lankan society mobilize at the same time, in such large numbers. 

Last night in Galle Face, I heard Tamil chants.

'Because of the path you took, we are out here on the streets'
