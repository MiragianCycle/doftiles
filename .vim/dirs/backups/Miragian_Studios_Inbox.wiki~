:TriLanka: :AppIdeas: :HobbyCodeProjets:  

- TriLanka: an app that helps you speak Sri Lankan
- 'SriLankan' an amalgamation of the linguistic richness and diversity of languages spoken by Sri Lankans
- The app will be a voice recorder 
  - Essentially people can go to the app to find out 'How do I say' <Pick a language> and a selection of phrases
  - It should also allow us to crowd source these phrases, and allow the user to indicate where in Sri Lanka they are from
  - The app should be available in all three languages 
  - This way, we will have a linguistic record of the many varieties, dialects and languages that make us Sri Lankan

- A Library Management Software for Bookworms, includes Print and Ebooks
- Should be able to search by Author, Publisher, Year of Publication, Genre, ISBN
- Nice to have: an ability to read ISBN barcodes and look up information, ask the user if that is correct, and - upon confirmation - should be able to update the library.
