= Agathinai = 

1. Reza called with a cool idea for a Tamil film
2. Conceptually it is based on the idea of the _Agathinai_, Sangam Tamil's approach to alluding to, and using landscape metaphors, for poetic purposes.
3. My idea connected this concept to a [[Hero's Journey,]] and Kim Ki Dai's [[_Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter....and Spring Again]]_
4. The 'plot' has to be simple because it should be the visuals that take precedence - simple plot to the point of being plotless
5. Possible ideas that are percolating in my brain include:
 
    a. Five inter-related stories connected by the idea of Karmic rebirth:
        - In this, we map each [[_Thinai_]] to a stage in the Hero's journey - except it isn't one hero we are talking about here, but multiple heroes
        - Each of these heroes will be connected via a Karmic thread, implying that they are the same soul born over and over again.
        - Each soul experiences a different stage of the Hero's Journey, at a vastly different time
        - To denote the passage of time, we will use costumes and makeup and even language to give a sense the passage of time 


**NOTE** Above is to be parked until Angelo's idea is properly fleshed out 
        
    b.  _What's the second idea?_  
        - [[Magnolia]] inspired film that is situated in 2022 Sri Lanka 
        - Six characters - we make them diverse
        - Each of them are connected in a 'cosmic' way on a 'mortal' stage: the stage being Sri Lanka
