=== WHAT THE ASSISTANT EDITOR NEEDS TO KNOW BEFORE THEY BEGIN === 

    ==== Before You Begin ==== 
    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvPHfUC-sD8|Link]]
    
        - 00:00 - Intro
            - An introduction to the faculty, and overview of the syllabus 
            
        - 02:12 - Before Production Begins
            - Before production begins, assistant editors can get a headstart
            - Being part of production meetings - insist on being part of them
            - Indi films especially have this issue since compartmentalization isn't happening
            - Visual FX in Indie films is often overlooked

        - 03:39 - Pre Production Meetings
            - Pre-production meetings are often overlooked during pre-production meetings
            - Prep-production meetings is a good opportunity to meet the sound recordist and other technical crew

        - 03:56 - Know Your Editor
            - Research the people that you will be working with
            - Especially the editor that you are going to intern for, it'd critical to know what they've worked on and their stylistic traits

        - 05:21 - Meet Your Team | Two Critical People in Set 
            - Besides the editor themselves, the most important person that the assistant editor will be working with is the *Script Supervisor*
            - It is critical to meet and establish a working relationship with the script supervisor. You will be talking to them alot. 'A good script supervisor is worth their weight in gold, and will be the primary voice of the editorial team at the set.' 
            - A 'Script Coordinator' is someone who is going to get [[Script_Sync]] for your edit - it is best to advice the production team beforehand that the services of a script coodinator is critial to a planned production

        - 07:37 - One Last (IMPORTANT) Thing
            - Finally, get very familiar with the script

    ==== Software Skills ====
    
        -  Project Organization 
           - Know your NLE
           - Learn as you go to a certain extent
           - Once you get into positions of responsibility, you have to know your tools indepth
           - It's impossible to know the full extent of NLEs
           - That said its important to understand that your NLE can adapt to the kind of film work that you will be doing. For example, Avid has a subset of features that are for cinema, another subset that is only for reality TV, and so on  
           - 'Change_Lists' are concepts that are relavant to certain kinds of filmed productions and not others
           - It is also critical to use the internet to network on specalist forums such as Premiere Professional Editors private group, and others
           - Lots of features of the software aren't obvious - forums are a good source for finding these tips 
           - Tell people if you don't know something - it's better to admit that you aren't aware of something at an early stage, instead of potentially causing damage  
           - Learning to edit as an individual is one skill, but learning to edit as part of an editorial team is a whole new skill that needs mastering since collaborative software come with their own need to learn and familiarize yourself with the ideas on a conceptual basis 
           - The most important thing that assistant editors can do is to keep the project organized
           - This helps the editor to work seamlessly when the director comes in
           - You are there to serve the editor's needs - they need to be able to find project material as and when they need
           - There is nothing wrong with your way of organizing being in direct opposition to the way your editor wants it organized - you must be able to adapt 
           - Also important to note that the Assistant Editor isn't just keeping track of media - they are keeping track of paper work, sound reports, etc., 
           - Organized means being organized within the NLE, and with non-media, non-digital information pertaining to the film outside the NLE
           - Besides being organized, Assistant Editors are also detectives who are there to solve problems when problems arise 
     
=== THE ASSISTANT EDITOR WORKFLOW ===

    ==== Prepping Dailies ==== 
      - One of the essential dailies is one of the foremost among their duties
      - You will often run into detective work with dailies - sometimes sound, script and camera notes may have discrepencies
      - If something seems wrong, speak of
      - For example, camera report can say there are 7 takes of scene 3A, when you've only recieved 5 takes - these discrepencies are very common, and its the job of the Assistant Editor to make note of them and speak up
      - Create checklists - Did you check camera reports, sound reports, or script notes? 
      - Be slow, be accurate, be methodical
      - There are two kinds of dailies - in big budgets, dailies will be synced but not in the case of small and medium independent films 
      - Tracking dailies has become an important skill since the days of sound being part of film

=== Personal Notes for reflection ===

1. I think this would have made my editing :PalaDoc: see [[Cinema|Cinema]] a lot easier
2. You live and learn
3. Apply these best practices to your YouTube workflow from the outset
4. It might be overkill for the scale of your 'productions' but it will instill the discipline needed
