# OPENING SEQUENCE:

= This opening sequence will introduce Pala to our audience in a highly stylized manner. There is a 'song' here too, but I haven't decided if it's the kaviya sung by Pala's father or the Kaviya sung at the start of the Thovil.

BLACK SCREEN:

The sound of a police walklie talkie. 

FADE IN:

EXT. A DARK FOREST - NIGHT  

A shaman (in voiceover) begins his incantation. He exclaims how fortunate it is for the afflicted one to be at the receiving end of a cosmic cleansing in the form of a *Shanti Karma*.

Against an inky black canvas, we see the fire from a torch being waved around like a musical instrument in slow motion. The movement of the torch and the fire it breathes is inviting the viewer to come forth. As the fire waves around it illuminates parts of its surroundings: a man in dark forest is beckoning us into the dark. 

He turns and walks into the abyss. 

We follow him. He is bare-chested. The torch, we see now, is made out of reeds and requires constant waving to keep it lit. The waving of the fire illuminates his bodily canvas, as well as the dark foliage of the forest around us. Against the canvas of his skin, a battle between light and shadow. Against the black canvas of the space around our guide are dissolving images: Pala's work, the devil masks, the ritual dancers, Pala's own face, and then...

The camera stops following. The man continues walking on and on, until eventually he is nothing more than a speck in the distance like a star from another galaxy whose light has travelled eons to reach us.

FADE TO: 

Black Screen. 

@PALA (VO): 
Duwa, I always wanted to be a ritual dancer like my father - your grandfather - and his uncle - my granduncle.

#ACT 1: 

= It is possible that act 1 is a little too compressed and/or abrupt. You may need the film to breathe a bit. Use b-roll and other supporting visuals to let the story breathe a bit. 

= i am also concerned that our main characters are speaking too fast. Maybe, a global slowing of their voice clips to around 95-85%, starting at the larger number and working my way down with small increments. Also remember that you have to ensure that Premiere or whatever it is doesn't alter the pitch of the original voice too much or at all, unless this is a desired effect. If so, use it with restraint and in modest frequency.  

= Remember to record voiceovers with Pala next week - identify sections that particularly need voiceovers. 

##SCENE 1 

EXT. THE MEDIRIPITIYA - SINHARAJA BORDER - DAY 
The sound of a peacock echoing across a jungle valley, dominating the sonicscape even though other bird calls can be heard, much softer and straining to be heard over the call of peacocks.

The camera is floating over the *Gin Ganga*, its path winding in sync with the rivers bends and whims, suddenly, an opening: a boat is moored a shore adjacent to a bridge. Just as the camera comes to a halt, we see a man cross the broken bridge followed by school children on the opposite end. The crossing of this obviously dangerous bridge is juxtaposed with the ghostly call and responses of the peacocks that populate this part of Sri Lanka. 

EXT. THE GIN GANGA BRIDGE - DRONE (OVERHEAD) - DAY 
We see a school boy and his mother cross the broken bridge. 

@PALA (VO): 
You see, we come from Deniyaya. This is ancient land with an ancient rainforest that has always seemed to want to swallow the town, but the river folds the jungle back, protecting our ancestors and us for thousands of years. 


@PALA (VO): 
I was born here in 1972, the year this country finally threw away its colonial name, and we named ourselves. 

##SCENE 2

CUT TO: 

EXT. THE PATH FROM HIS HOME TO THE SCHOOL - MEDIUM SHOT - DAY 
This is an over the shoulder medium shot shot as he is walking back turned to the camera, occasionally looking over his shoulder and breaking the fourth wall. 

= This section is from 06:20 onwards 

@PALA: 
This is the path that we would take back and forth from school to our home. All of us - younger ones, and older ones, all walked to school together. But since school ended earlier for us little ones, we'd have to walk back home from school alone.   

@PALA: 
You see, our fathers and their ancestors have belief in the supernatural. They believe that there is a race of demons that inhabit the earth, and that it is possible to ward them away through ritual and dance. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. A RITUAL GROUND - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 

A dancer walks into frame, a large light hanging over him. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. BACK STAGE - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

A dancer, back turned to camera walks through the curtains into the stage - from between the flaps of the curtain, we see this second dancer dance in front of the afflicted one, though we don't see the afflicted one's face.

CUT TO: 

EXT. A PATH THROUGH A FOREST - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT  

@PALA: 
This path was filled with folklore and myth - so I used to curse aloud to ward the demons away from me.  People used to believe that demons lived along the paths closest to rivers and streams so I was terrified. The sound of the river, even in the distance, combined with the isolation that comes from being in this path made it scary. So I would curse aloud to make sure the demons don't grab me. This was until people heard me and complained to my father. They used to call me 'Ratha' back then. They'd tell my father, 'look your Ratha is curing aloud while walking'. 

CUT TO: 
##SCENE 3: 

EXT. THE POTUPITIYA HOUSEHOLD - DAY - AERIAL SHOT 
Back in the 60s the government gave this one acre of land to my father. So he moved in with his mother and began a family. They weren't married, you see. These were folks that didn't have the exposure to British lifestyles of weddings and marriages - they weren't brainwashed.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. THE POTUPITIYA HOUSEHOLD - DAY
We see Pala walking to his house. He walks in, talking to his mother.

@PALA (TO HIS MOTHER):
Back then, this seemed like such a large house. 

CUT TO: 
##SCENE 4: 

EXT. THE FOREST - NIGHT 
Pala with his flaming reed torch, back turned to the camera. He is walking away from the camera, as in the opening sequence but this time, we are keeping pace with him. 

@PALA'S MOTHER (VO):
Once when he was young, and his father wasn't home, I was putting all the children to bed at night, when I realized he was missing. I looked everywhere but couldn't find him. Finally, I go to light the kerosene lamp, and I find him near a hearth, staring at the fire, 

CUT TO: 

INT. A LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Pala's mother shows how she found him, face buried, sitting near a fire. I shook him a bit to wake him up, and when he did I asked him what he was doing. And he said, someone had come to him, woken him up, asked him to sit there till they come back. That happened... [laughs] 

@PALA (VO) 
Our people are called the Navandhana. We are supposed to be lower than farmers in the social totem pole....[his voice is drowned out by a passing motorbike]. We also hear the first notes of a song being sung off screen by an obviously older man. 

CUT TO: 
## SCENE 5: 

EXT. A STREAM - DAY - AERIAL

The singing overlaps into this shot. 

We are peaking from above the trees at an old man sitting on a rock, peacefully at content with everything around him. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. MEDIUM SHOT, THE OLD MAN ON THE ROCK - DAY 
We see Pala's father at work at his desk in the house. 

@PALA'S FATHER:
The Navandhana people are makers. They are called that because they have knowledge of nine arts. 

= from Zoom 10, first minute

@PALA'S FATHER (VO): 
I learnt these arts from my uncle. He would finish a Thovil in another village and stay over at our family home. He'd hand over some of his costumes to me and tell me to repair little tears and damages that come about when performing.

@PALA (VO):
One thing I noticed about my granduncle is that his work had real quality to it. There was a conceptual foundation to his works that struck me as a child. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. RITUAL GROUND - NIGHT 
The sound of a bera being played, and eventually the bera is in focus.

@PALA (VO): 
I was closer to my granduncle than I was to my grandfather. I loved him, and he loved me back. He'd stay in our house after performing in other villagers because I loved the smell of *dumala* that was on him when he came over after a performance. 

CUT TO:
EXT - A COMMUNAL GROUND. A RITUAL. WE SEE A GURUNANSA AT THE DRUMS IN SLOW MOTION, HINTING THAT THIS WAS WHAT THE UNCLE AND PALA'S FATHER WERE DOING. 

= The following bit will be slowed down and chopped - give it space to breathe. Remember this is dream logic - you can shift space, time and other things to fit inside the rules - but once you create an internal logic rule, stick to it. 

= The following section is also the first appetizer before the 'musical interlude'. You can let this breathe even more than the usual dialogue sections. 

@PALA'S (VO):
I remember this one time, there was *thovil* where uncle was the *Gurunansa*. Suddenly there was wailing and weeping, like someone had died. Then they took him to the back of the house. When they brought him back, he looked dead. I touched him, and he was dead. 
Then they buried him. 
I was scared because I was very fond of uncle, and thought he was dead. 
But then, suddenly there were cries from the burial mound. So they dug him out, and uncle came out, a live.

CUT TO:

EXT - PADDY FIELD - DAY 

= This is to be separately recorded over voice. 

@PALA: 
Like I said, this isn't a story you will see in your textbooks.
