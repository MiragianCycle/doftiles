== Mozzarella and Mushroom Sandwich == 
=== Special notes === 
/This is for one person, scaling is still to be figured out/. 

*INGREDIENTS* 

1. 4 Bottom mushrooms large
2. 1 large onion 
3. 1 large tomato
4. 4 slices of sandwich bread of your choice - white is what I've tried, need to try with other types of bread 
5. 3 green chillies
6. 1 clove garlic
7. Herbs of your choosing - I've tried a herb mix consisting of thyme, basil, rosemary and it is delicious
8. Paprika
9. Turmeric 
10. Chilli powder
11. Salt n Peppa'


*DIRECTIONS*

1. Keep mushrooms soaked in tap water for about 10 minutes; wash thoroughly before slicing vertically
2. You may remove the stalks of the shrooms, and chop them separately
3. Chop the vegetables up and put it into a separate bowl: onions, garlic, green chillies, tomatoes
4. In this bowl, mix thoroughly, allowing the juices of each of the chopped veggies to soak into one another
5. Mix the salt, pepper, chilli powder, paprika and turmeric, and continue mixing until the veggies have coated the spices and herb into the mix
6. Heat frying pan with oil for 2 minutes. 
    i. Add a pinch of salt
    ii. Add a pinch of pepper
    iii. Add cardamon, mustard seeds to the oil
7. Once the pan is nice and hot, add the chopped vegetables
8. Stir fry on high heat for two minutes, reduce heat high medium 
9. Wait two minutes until onions are caramelized, and then add chopped mushrooms
10. Continue stir frying 
11. Start toaster, and coat the surface of the toaster with butter. Once butter has melted, sprinkle a dash of herbs on this surface. This will add the herbs on to the outside surface of the bread when it is being toasted - giving it a beautiful look, and wonderful aroma
12. The mushrooms should be cooked at high medium heat for about 2-5 mins. Keep an eye to make sure it isn't burning. 
13. I like reducing the heat to low at the two minute mark, and then cover the pan for the remainig three minutes
14. Remove the mushrooms from the pan 
15. Lay a slice of bread on the butter-coated toastie surface
16. Add the stir-fried mushrooms, taking care to flatten it out as widely as possibly before laying the top slice of bread. 
17. Add Mozarella on top of the mushrooms, again making sure it is flattened
18. Before closing the toastie, add some butter to the top slice of bread 
19. Sprinkle a dash of your herbs, like you did into the butter coating, but this time on the top slice of bread.
20. Let the toastier finish making the sandwich.
21. Eat.
