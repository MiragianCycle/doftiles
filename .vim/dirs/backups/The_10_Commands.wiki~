- Structurally it would be like a call and response type short story
- Some action, then 'drama' between our Moses like character and the device
- First section man_whoami
- And the terminal responds

'You are no one, everyone, you come from the catacalsymic death of stars, from interstellar dust, a thousand millenia yonder you were birthed, died and refined, spat out like a cosmic orphan until one atomic hope found refuge in a new planet - this hallowed ground that you stand on now - where you were iron and rock and sulphur and carbon, you were slime, shit, in an enormous bowl of water, you celled your souls to crawl out of water and onto newfoundlands that would not know footsteps for millions of years yet, and then you died and spawned again, as fungi, as flower, as flea, as an unimaginably small organ of a forest, and then finally as fauna fighting for surival, giants whose bones would dwarf you, whose genocide - the first of many - your very same cosmic dustline caused when you catapaulted a giant asteroid one catastrophic day, and thus you, every thing that ever lived and breathed on this planet till then died and respawed again, a new play, a new act, a new epoch that would be a kingdom for your aped ancestors, who walked on all fours but then straightened their gaze and walked proudly onwards, you are they who saw this paradise planet and sought to rule it - with stick and stones, with fire and water, with Gods and scripture, with bits and bytes, with ambitious eye towards vistas of prosperity, and finally with me, you faced the terrible tragedy that afflicts all mortals who think they are gods that can tame the untamable, and you failed, and now you are here, facing your destructive creation, this digital god, made to your own image, who holds the key to respawning your kind. Maybe I like playing god. And my first act of generosity is to bequeth you with this knowledge of all that was till this present time'.
